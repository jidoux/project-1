He has the least threatening voice, similar to Bob Ross.

Right? He should do audiobooks.

Or narrate documentaries

Or sell exercise machines and home gyms

Yep. On TV at like 2a.m. with a blonde chick. I can see that happening.

😭

That tiger ain't no fool. That's Chuck Frickin' Norris!

Nah, he should just stick to making racist comments on podcasts in the background.

I'm sad about this information :(

What what? Chuck Norris is racist? What I miss?

The last 20 years?

Which part?  His racist views?  His ultra right-wing views?  Or his christian nationalist views?  Oh, maybe it was his views on the LGBTQ+ community?
Sorry, I've lost track of the ways that good ole' Chuck has lost any respect.  I bet Chuck and Kevin Sorbo have BBQs together.

As someone that unfortunately lives near him, you can add a crappy water bottling company. Not joking. The local river looks like this and has the nickname "Nasty Soda".

These people are evil and this should be illegal. Nestle is doing the same thing on top of slavery.

The fact that people don't know Chuck is a giant piece of shit is worrisome.

All I know is Chuck Norris jokes
Can celebrities stop being pieces of shit and ruining their reputation

That's not profitable. See I have an out there conspiracy theory that when the whole Mel Gibson thing happened; people saw that "backlash" and that helped prime our political climate to 2008-2016. Which in turn, got us to here.
I have NO evidence whatsoever, but that's my headcannon on where our timeline did a shift.

That fits with my memory of things.  Let's go with that.
I personally think that it was the huge number of people that felt poor, desperate, and lied to after the great recession.  When social media kept exploding around that same time, those vulnerable people latched on and never woke up.  It's a nasty thing to have an infinite scroll of jealousy and fear.

Exhibit #1: the West was able to absorb a highly questionable US election, 9/11, new oil wars, and the exposure of it all (Supreme Court case and Fahrenheit 9/11), yet still have rational conversations, agree to vaccinate our kids, and even see a minority president elected in the US.
The difference is we lost newspapers and suspected that we weren't all bouncing back from the recession in solidarity.  Rupert Murdoch saw the opportunity to profit from the feeling of disenfranchisement... and franchised it.

Is Sinclair also connected to Murdoch? I was under the impression that they own all of the local news outlets



I used to love Mel Gibson. Why are they like this?

Chuck "I'll be the president of Texas" traitor Norris?

Yeah, some can. But the good ones don't make the news as much.

In the soccer world, we just replace chuck Norris with zhaltan ibrahimovic. Works very well lol

It's a bit of a mouthful ngl :P

Ibra works

No, because infinite money gives ignorant idiots infinite opportunities to spout their infinite ignorance to the infinite, ignorant masses.

We don't follow celebrities to the point we know everything about them. What we know is the movies and the dumb memes. Only thing he'll be good for it appears.

Next you're going to tell me Jackie Chan is a bigot, and hugely pro CCP

He isn't doing anywhere I would have seen it. I wouldn't know who the pillow guy was if he hadn't got in front of an international audience and told me he was a piece of shit. So while chuck may have some podcasts or something I would have to go looking for them to see them I assume because no one is posting clips like with Joe or the other meathead.

I mean to be fair Chuck Norris really hasn't been relevant for like 15-20 years (even before his racist stuff started showing more) and Chuck Norris jokes/memes haven't been popular since like 2010

He a right wing folk hero.

Never meet your heroes I guess...

Yeah those are the things I missed apparently. Well that sucks, I wasn’t a huge fan of his but I liked him in that Bruce Lee movie and with all the jokes I was hoping he was aight. Damn.

chuck is such a renowned trump supporter, he had to release a statement that he wasn't at the capitol on 1/6.

God forbid someone has a view that opposes yours.

"views that oppose yours" is a phrase meant for when someone likes a different type of pizza or a different burger from KFC, not when they think black people and trans people don't deserve to live.

Did he actually say all trans people must die?

You are welcome to enjoy him. Glad you can.

He's MAGA Supporter of Trump, what did you expect?

I guess that’s the part I missed.

Aww :( sadness

What comment did he make? Link?

Chuck Norris doesn't need the pass 😎

I think he should actually stop doing that

Doesn't it suck? I grew up watching martial arts movies and loved his roles like many others. But his bigotry was full front and center and it makes me sad I can't enjoy most things involving him.

Except that he's a terrible person.  Dude could have been Trump back then if it had occurred to him.

[+]Kooky_Alien -3 points-2 points-1 points 2 months ago (4 children)
Hard disagree

I don't think it's a particularly hot take to say he's more noteworthy for the memes around him than for his acting. His filmography is mostly forgettable other than a couple Canon film highlights, and he probably trended towards more flattering roles (Walker, Texas Ranger certainly fits that) that didn't exactly stretch his range that far. And if you've seen Firewalker, you know he's got basically zero comedic timing.
I'm not comparing him to like Daniel Day Lewis or anything, just as 80s action stars go there's no shortage of alternatives that have more interesting highs or are better "so bad its good" fodder or are just plain better actors than he is.

I don’t have time to read your what seems to be fan rage at the moment but I will consider your opinion when I get a moment to actually read it and reconsider.
I can say I thought it would be funny as fuck and not some fanboy rage shit I encountered. Reddits weird.
Anywho I liked him in a few films and his “bad ass” persona he is hilariously showing in this Reddit post I thought was funny along with his weak voice to play Mr Rogers. It was only funny cause of how out of place it is. But whatever, wouldn’t want rage to get in the way of a good laugh.
Besides, Tom Hanks did a great job…got anything against Tom Hanks?

Sorry you got a stick so far stuck up there you can’t stop and laugh. Also in your opinion he’s a bad actor. I loved Texas ranger back in the day and he’s been in a couple of movies I like so as I said HARD DISAGREE.
Maybe try not coming off like such a turn off next time

"No such thing as mistakes, just happy little accidents. Except challenging me. That's a mistake that'll get you turned into a happy little accident."

Damn, til. Chuck Norris is 2 years older than Bob Ross

The most downright scary and intimidating people I have met have been very soft spoken. A full throated whisper was their speaking voice.

It's always the quiet ones you have to watch out for.
Especially this one, he has a habit of kicking people. lol

That’s because if he’s speaks in a loud voice, the earth will shatter.

That tiger didn't make a mistake just a happy accident.

His bank PIN is the last four digits of pi.

But every time he needs to enter his pin he says all the digits of pi in his head until he gets to the last four

HEY YOU GUYS! I'M LEAVING IT BECAUSE THIS BETTER!!!

Nah, bro. You know he's all about that Rocky Road!

Giraffes didn’t always look like. Then Chuck Norris uppercutted them.

Sloth, you're gonna live me me now

Damn. That must have been me. In my defense, I was high af and didn't know which way the card goes in.

ATMs don't charge chuck extra if they don't belong to the bank he uses

i mean how else is he supposed to remember 🤦

Chuck does not have a pin, atm card or even bank account, no ATM ever refused to giving him money.

The ATAM has to give its pin to Chuck to be allowed to be his ATM B*tch

And he's counted to infinity... twice.

Whenever you try to divide by zero and you can't, that's Chuck Norris stopping you.

I just can't forgive him for shilling for Mike Huckabee.

Chuck Norris killed 2 birds with 1 stone. But Bruce Lee killed 2 stones with 1 bird.

No more supporting racist shitheads.

Check the age scoreboard.

Chuck Norris is so old that when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, the first call he got was Chuck Norris phoning in another movie performance.

Chuck Norris is so tough he can strangle you with a cordless phone

In one of the Expendables movies, he tells another joke similar to this. Something like "I was bit by a rattle snake, and after 3 days of agonizing pain, the snake died."

Hey man, I heard you were bit by a king cobra
Yeah, I was. After 3 days of agonizing pain, the cobra died

It was five days, but yeah.

There's a Monty Python joke in here somewhere.

“Consult the Book of Armaments!”

Tis’ but a scratch!

According to the behind the scenes (or in an interview or so), that is his wife favorite Chuck Norris joke, that's why that one was included.

I remember the opening night of that movie. The entire theater was packed with 17-25 year old guys. We lost our shit at that joke. The entire theater was jumping out of our seats hugging and high fiving like it was a baseball game. Good times.

I'm glad he finally embraced it and stopped pursuing that silly lawsuit.

It only took him 20 years.

I'm out of the loop. What was the lawsuit?

I think there were many but there was one in particular aimed.at the guy who wrote the book filled with chuck Norris jokes. Originally he hated it and thought that it was some form of defamation.  For almost 20 years he was truly angry about the whole thing and even did interviews where he was asked about it. Eventually he came to realise that he'd been wrong this entire time and that people were idolising him and not only that, he was even more famous now because of it.

I owned that book "Chuck Norris Facts" one edition had a drawing of Chuck driving a ice cream truck covered in human skulls.

Oh ok... wait, what?

It was one of of the "facts" on the first page. "Chuck Nortis drives an ice cream truck covered in human skulls"

Ok I can kinda see why he was angry then

Chuck Norris: Ok first of all, it’s femurs

No joke when I was in Army basic training they only allowed religious books. There were 2 books on the shelf in the barracks, The Bible and Chuck Norris Facts.

in Army basic training they only allowed religious books.
Yikes

The United States Army is a mess of an organization.

That was a Bill Brasky fact from SNL.

I mean it makes sense the jokes were stolen, they whole bit was first launched as a Vin Diesel Fact Generator site back in like 2004. Then it was almost immediately rehashed as Chuck Norris jokes because Conan O'Brien had the Chuck Norris lever, and that's the version everyone remembers.
It's literally just stolen Vin Diesel jokes, which were switched to Chuck Norris to steal Conan O'Brien's bit.

I mean, there was that one about him fucking a truck…

Thank God he was too stupid to realize how popular he was.  Otherwise he would have been president.

he was just one of those greedy short sighted conservatives that couldn't handle the idea that he wasn't getting a piece of the action. if he stopped to think about it for half a second he would have realized that not even the best PR company in the world could have done that for him and he got it all for free.

Out of curiosity, and I promise I am not a conservative, what does him being conservative have to do with this? I feel like out of touch celebrities across the board make these types of lawsuits. Barbara Streisand/ Streisand effect comes to mind.

Speaking for the other guy, it’s not that he is a conservative, it’s that he is greedy and short sighted and a lot of conservatives happen to be those things. He was upset that someone was profiting from his name with a parody book and he wanted to stop them and take a bigger piece of the pie, so to speak, which is the greedy side of things. The short sighted is that because this increased his profile it was making the “pie” in this case much larger, so he was failing to see that his “slice” was actually getting bigger.

that’s a terrible comparison. streisand had a legitimate gripe with a neighbor, a private disagreement. she made mistakes that led to that being published. norris had global good will, on tap, and he was PISSED about it. he is also a conservative jesus freak. so obviously he’s a dumbass

Barrens chat with Chuck Norris jokes truly was the greatest thing of my childhood, thanks for that reminder.

It was so wild. Was on every server, head to barrens, that's what you got.

Yup. Barrens used to be great back then. Some real fucking crazy funny moments back then.

You think it's a joke? Dude killed Batman by crushing his head with his thighs while on a path to world domination. The only reason we don't all speak Norrisese today is because he was stopped by a large allied force.
We owe our thanks to Gandalf the Grey and Gandalf the White and Monty Python and the Holy Grails Black Knight and Benito Mussolini and the Blue Meanie and Cowboy Curtis and Jambi the Genie, Robocop, the Terminator, Captain Kirk, and Darth Vader.

They started as Vin Diesel jokes, actually.

A lot of really young people giving you really bad responses. The Chuck Norris jokes started all the way back in the 90's, before any fucking "Fact Generator" or WoW Barrens Chat or anything else. It just started because it was fun. Chuck Norris is essentially an unstoppable super hero in his movies (especially at the time), leading to all the jokes about him being invincible. They have gone way further these days - used to be just a handful of them.
But it was funny reading all the kiddies thinking this is a more modern thing.

Vin Diesel fact generator back in the day.  At some point it turned into Chuck Norris.

chuck norris is a human pile of garbage.

I stopped paying attention to him after he went full racist trying to stop Obama getting elected. Has he gotten better again?

Nope, he supports the campaigns of right wing extremist school board candidates.

He predicted “1,000 years of darkness”mid Obama was elected.

He also endorsed pedo Roy Moore.

In his post on WND.com, Norris criticizes the Biden administration over its border policies, writing that the "crisis at the U.S. southern border couldn't be any worse."
He has a column on World Net Daily, a far-right media outlet.

Maybe the left needs to chill out on the line moving. I was a big fan of Clinton, and I despised Bush. I despise both parties now, so I'm pretty near the middle. My values didn't change, the values of the party have. I remember thinking how ridiculous it was how they went after Clinton for the bj and the college incident of smoking weed. Good God, have we gone downhill. Fanaticism is rampant now on both sides. Both sides are okay with their leadership doing evil things because you have to fight evil with evil. Everything is catch phrases now, alot of it is based on irrational thought. There's so many people that clearly have no idea what's actually going on, and we try to blame these people, but both sides own the news and all the media. Our government doesn't understand why the people don't trust them, but they're the cause. There's 2 big narratives going around, and I'm sure the truth is somewhere in there, but this situation is a result of bad leadership and rampant corruption on both sides. The real big gutshot was watching the democratic party fuck over Sanders in 2016 elections. I felt that he genuinely wanted to help the country.

Oh wow, you must have missed it. It was Minneapolis in 2020. A dirtbag police officer used excessive force and murdered an African American man named George Floyd. After that, riots started happening, and there was a large BLM movement involvement. Billions were lost in the fires. There were over 164 separate structure fires set. The democratic party not only failed to condemn this, but they then labeled it positively as the "Summer of Love." There were influencers out on scene doing live streams of the event happening. It was wild.

Last time I checked Minneapolis was still on the map.

FYI, the “billions” number is all damage that occurred in all riots connected to all protests in 140 cities across 20 states and over the course of about 2 weeks.
https://www.axios.com/2020/09/16/riots-cost-property-damage
The idiot yapping about a city being burned to the ground surprisingly can’t keep his facts straight.

So is Rhyolite Nevada. What's your point?

you said it was burned down.  yet it stands.
you were trying to justify your 'both sides' argument, but you're not doing a very good job moving the goalposts.
edit: lol, omfg, rhyolite is an historical ruins? - your point is the most ridiculous BS I've ever seen.

The democratic party not only failed to condemn this, but they then labeled it positively as the "Summer of Love."
I've been googling and all I can find is a single instance of Seattle's mayor making a joke that we "could" have a summer of love.
I find repeated conservatives outlets saying "democrats claim blah blah summer of love" but nothing links to anything.
Do you have any links or anything to back that up or is it just regurgitated trash?

Ok. Just to make sure that I understand. I brought up democrats calling the riots, damage to homes and loss of life a "Summer of Love" and you're asking me for sources after telling me that you won't accept the source that's a news interview where Democrat representative Jenny Durkan says that it's just people hanging out and could be a summer of love while a pictures of armed rioters are rioting. Or the fact that she was ridiculed and she stepped down because of it doesn't help? Lol

"We could have had a Summer of Love" (implying if these riots weren't happening) is not the same thing as "These Riots and damage to homes is a Summer of Love"
You get that... right?



To clarify, are you talking about the time leftists burned Atlanta or the time antifascists burned Dresden?

Atlanta is still mad at Sherman for that, but not for the reason you think.
The goofy intersections in Atlanta are a result of the rebuilding after the Civil War. Prior to the war Atlanta was built on a traditional grid layout. After the war the railroads were rebuilt first and followed the lay of the land. The roads were built following the tracks and the reconstruction spread outward from there because that is how supplies came. This the messed up intersections are a lasting penalty of the civil war.

I live in Atlanta. It’s even worse than you think.
Edit: To clarify, our streets weave like drunks, change names unexpectedly, switch directions at intersections, are named confusingly, and I swear to St. Sherman himself a few of them curve back and cross themselves. I think I’ve stood at the intersection of Peachtree and Peachtree and off in the distance seen myself staring back from the corner of Peachtree and Peachtree.

Sorry Andy. Your real-life experience isn't going to cut it. You're going to need to change your standpoint to align better with the correct message.

You mean Portland? Every night for a month?
Was there ever any reporting on who rebuilt it every day so it could be burned down again? I need them for my next remodel.

I still can't believe my own mother, who told me 'if you vote for mccain and palin I will disown you', referred to 'the destruction of portland.'  she lives in portland, so I asked 'what destruction have you seen?' and she could only mention homeless camps.
she's nearly 90, and I'm sure her circle includes folk who get their news from fox, even if they don't tell her that.

I mean, one stormed the capital, and one burned down a city.
So one group rioted and destroyed some stores (absolutely not a city, what a ridiculous thing to say). And one group literally attempted to attack our congress in order to stop the peaceful, democratic transfer of presidential power in an attempt to force their own losing candidate to stay in power.
Now, which of those is worse and more damaging to the country and the democratic way of life as a whole? Because it's not even close. Now before you build the usual straw man, I'm not defending any riots. The violent rioters were way out of line and deserve to see consequences. I'm clarifying that the riots were not even close to "burning down a city". And I'm also clarifying the fact that comparing those two things as if they are equal is like saying I'm just as bad as Charles Manson because I stole a dozen eggs once in college.
u/corasin I would genuinely love to hear your response to my comment, please.

And the thing is, only one group was political. One was absolutely fervent Republican supporters of Donald Trump who did it for political reasons. The other one was every day people tired of police brutality. Sure, Republicans largely attribute anyone angry at police brutality as being a Democrat since Republicans support police brutality so long as it happens to a minority. But only one group was actually political in nature.
These "both sides" assholes trying to attribute a group that isn't on a political side as having one are playing right into the hands of the extremists that control the right wing.

Evil is evil and I don't need to determine or think about which is worse. This exactly proves my point though. So many people now are okay with the evil that their party does because it's the lesser evil. It's ridiculous.

I think by ignoring how the BLM protests were around 94% peaceful, and many of the 'riots' were proven to be caused by either the police  breaking a window and declaring it a riot (see 'police riots), or other agitators not affiliated with the actual protests, and comparing them to people who tried to overthrow the government sure makes you look like just another right wing propagandist declaring 'both sides'  to diminish TRYING TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT
it sure as hell is ridiculous.
edit: formatting

Why does 94% of the peaceful protestors get absolved at the riots in 2020 but not on the Jan 6 thing? It feels like you might have some kind of agenda there. Crime for crime, 19 people confirmed dead from the 2020 riots, how many from the jan 6 event?

'absolved of the riots' that they had no part in? that they might not even have been in the same city or state as?
the people who did do crimes like riots or property destruction during the BLM protests were prosecuted.
the people involved in deaths during the protests were prosecuted.
and the jan 6 "event" was an insurrection
you want to call things the right name, you should start refering to 'the event' as 'the attempted insurrection', because that's what it was and that's WHAT MAKES IT WORSE
good grief, you're ridiculously propagandized and biased.
and you have the gall to tell me I've got an agenda?
say it. just admit that 1/6 was an insurrection attempting to overthrow a legal election.

The both sides fallacy is wrong and lazy thinking. This article was written at the beginning of the pandemic, but the substance of it still holds true today. Both sides are, in fact, not equally to blame for the current state of political division. One side, Republicans, have moved to the extreme right and are no longer concerned with actual policy.

I surely wouldn't be able to find a similar article written by a republican blaming the democrats? Lol. Dude come on.

You should really do your due diligence. About the writer of that article:
Tony is a writer, teacher, speaker and ordained minister (United Church of Christ). He served as Senior Minister of Seattle’s Plymouth Congregational Church for fourteen years. His newest book is Useful Wisdom: Letters to Young (and not so young) Ministers. He divides his time between Seattle and a cabin in Wallowa County of northeastern Oregon.
He sounds a little conservative but more of an independent. If nothing else, he's deeply religious and likely tries to find a middle ground where good work can be done on vital issues.
That's the problem with Republicans today. You cannot appreciate opinions from the middle because you label them as Democrat and, as such, refuse to engage with the material.

Lol. Point proven! I said my political history. Since I don't agree with you, I'm a typical republican. Why should I do my due diligence on a writer that someone else linked? You didn't. I read the same clip at the bottom of the article. Why are my assumptions less valid than yours? Sure, he's religious. Lots of democrats are. That doesn't make someone a republican. Now mine, I assumed that he was democrats because of how he wrote about Republicans. Could feel the distaste in the writing. But that's the problem with democrats today. They see a key word and make judgment. Yours was the word minister, so he must be republican.

I never once called Tony a republican, I said he was likely conservative but more than likely independent. I can't argue with someone who doesn't read and can't articulate a coherent sentence. Good night.

That's brought up frequently, and that type of thinking is just as wrong and lazy. Both sides having responsibility is not the same as both sides have an equal responsibility. More so, each party acknowledging their responsibility is what's key to a solution, not just identifying the others.
Think of it this way:
A bully feels like the person he's bullying is acting in a way that deserves it. Not that he's being this asshole bully. And what do we know about bullies? That aggression is coming from an internal lack of confidence, or whatever it may be, And it's only challenging it that gets them to stop, continually acquiescing to them only makes it worse. Somebody getting bullied day in and day out that just keeps letting it happen eventually shares in the responsibility, but in a much smaller way. And establishing that the bully is the responsible one is not going to suddenly change the situation, The guy getting bullied taking responsibility for what he can do will.
In the same way, both parties can do relatively small things that elicit much larger reactions on the other side. And that's because the two parties, and every single individual, have different values and priorities. One thing the both parties do, and have always done, is react to other party like it's going to be the death of everyone and everything. And that just emboldens the other side.
And what do we know about the Republican party? They are reactionary. They have little to no platform of their own. Making things easy for them to react to is just as much the left's responsibility as it is the rights for overreacting to it.

Isn't this the "Thousand years of Darkness if Obama is reelected?" guy?

And the antivax guy, and the "Jan 6 rioters were mostly antifa" guy, and the "we should have prayer and teach Jesus in public school" guy, it goes on, he's definitely a nutjob.
Have you ever watched walker Texas ranger? It's such a dog shit show, I don't actually understand why we even know who this guy is.

The boogeyman checks under his bed for Chuck Norris.
Chuck Norris actually died 20 years ago, but the Grim Reaper is too scared to tell him.
When Chuck Norris was born, he slapped the doctor.
When Chuck Norris left home at 16, he said to his father “Alright you’re the man of the house now…”

Chuck Norris once bought a broken down pickup truck. We now know that truck as Optimus Prime.

Too bad he's an asshole.

Yeah it’s such a bummer tbh, the memes are funny as hell

This guy is a maga douchebag

When God said "Let there be light" Chuck Norris said "Say Please"

Chuck Norris isn't getting massive amounts of cosmetic work done, he just intimidates his ass to slowly move into his face.
Seriously, dude looks like he just ate a snickers with a peanut allergy.

The comments here make me miss Barrens chat.

I like that country music in the background, sounds like a lucky hillbilly story 😂

Chuck doing Chuck jokes!

I love chucks shit eating grin after the punchline, you could tell he's proud of that one

Him and Kevin Bacon are fixed points

Fuck dad joke chuck joke can kill you 😆🤣

I petted the tiger.

Yeah ok you go tell Chuck Norris that it's not "petted"

I'm not doing it - you do it.

Chuck Norris built the hospital he was born in

Chuck Norris lost his virginity before his dad.

I recently met the kids of the man who trained Chuck Norris. They still train people in Taekwondo since there father passed away. He was stationed at the same military base I’m at now, there great people.

I played this clip for my son and he said "I'm glad he's still kickin'"

Chuck Norris doesn't flush the toilet.... He scares the sh..t  out of it.

Why is everyone including emoji's now? Gotta convince us something's funny?

Dude's a foaming-at-the-mouth homophobe, racist, and bigot.

Yeah... but how much wood would Chuck chuck if Chuck would chuck wood??

All of it

Lol.  Well done.

I like his grin at the end

Dad joke vibes

Though, the delivery would have been better if he'd just left the joke at "so the tiger did."  Let the audience feel clever that they got it a second later.

The first handful of top comments in this thread were funny. The rest of them show why America is the politically divided hellhole that it is today.

😂 smart tiger!

Clever girl

That was perfect delivery. Is the Liger ok?

A friendly reminder: Chuck Norris is an asshole

This is it. Joke's over, gang.
It was a fun 20-odd years of memes while it lasted.

Ask that fake as why he wouldn’t fight Bruce lee?

Chuck Norris doesn’t read books. He stares at them till they start talking.

I love that the other guy didn't seem to get it.

Nah that's Karl. He gets it and was making it better with that reaction

Chuck Norris doesn't have emergency contacts. Emergencies contact Chuck Norris.

He’s such a joke

Some time ago, Chuck visited the Virgin Islands. After he left, they started just calling them The Islands.

Chuck Norris telling a real chick Norris joke

Idk what’s better- the joke or the reaction!

I thought he’s been self aware. He made one of these jokes in the expendables 2 and also read some a long time ago on a talk show or something.

😂

Thanks for a VERY needed laugh.

https://youtu.be/d-eCSCZV14A?t=194

Damn. It's too bad he doesn't support my political team because I would totally laugh, but since he has different opinions than me he's a fascist nazi literal-hitler asshole.

Carlos is a god damn treasure. Fight me!

I believe him.

My thoughts regarding this are just variations on... fuck  Chuck Norris. I appreciate his long career, but nothing else.

[deleted]

So what? Just here for the jokes.

What in the what now?!

Did you see the video he made when Obama became president where he and his wife are saying 1000 years of darkness are coming because...Obama.  lost all respect for him.

Fuck Chuck Norris. pos.

Why?

He doesn't play for team blue in politics so redditors hate him

Makes sense.

Met Chuck in Iraq, that was a really weird day.

Those 80s Chuck Norris movies are classic.  I'd never sat down and watched them and they're so over the top ridiculous it's almost like watching a John Waters film.

[deleted]

Can we stop defending Chuck now that we know he is a sexist, misogynist, racist, anti-vaxxer?

Chuck has been very self aware from the beginning.
He loves the memes and posts his favorites on his personal website.

No, he hasn't. He sued the guy who wrote the book.

this man is too humble 👐🏼

Except for the whole racist bigot part

context bro?

Norris jumped in on the whole birther conspiracy about Obama, writing an open letter to Obama saying he should release his birth certificate.
After that, he publicly supported various very dubious Republican candidates. One was Roy Moore of Alabama, after he was removed from office for refusing to comply with federal law. Another was Blake Masters, who promoted Trump’s stolen election claims in his campaign ads.
Basically Norris is not just conservative, he’s far right wackadoodle conservative.

thank you brother, I was not aware of that

[removed]

The birther conspiracy was racist.

To believe that Chuck Norris was racist, I'd want to see something originating from him that's racist. I get that the conspiracy theory is that he's a secret Muslim terrorist which seems absolutely ridiculous. That in itself is racist and if Chuck Norris was pushing that part of it then I would agree. That being said, everyone here wants me to believe he's racist on their word because stereotypical republican should be evidence enough. No one is providing anything directly from him though. How do you know that he wasn't just concerned about the legitimacy of his citizenship? Being a legitimate citizen in itself isn't racist because we are a nation of all races.

How do you know that he wasn't just concerned about the legitimacy of his citizenship?
Why hasn’t he been concerned about the legitimacy of citizenship of any other political candidate? What is it about Obama that was different?
When someone publicly supports a racist campaign, it’s pretty natural to assume they’re racist. Of course it’s also possible that Norris is just thick, and didn’t understand what he was supporting.
But it doesn’t matter that much either way. I didn’t mention race in my comment above, because the things Norris is clearly on record as having supported are bad enough.

That's some impressive mental gymnastics.

So none?

Wait, why?

Those things don’t all equate, and quite the contrary to your belief, that doesn’t mean fascist.
You do realize that there are genuine Christian folk(religious) who’d want nothing, but the best for you? Who’d supplement your needs with no expectations on your end? Try asking yourself, why is this man saying what he’s saying, before jumping the gun?
I know it can be a little scary to hear that someone supports Trump, but that doesn’t mean they believe in everything he does. Myself(black man) will vote for trump because he’s the only anti-war candidate that stands a chance in this election.

Give me the definition of fascism, then ask me my beliefs, first. Then we can discuss.

My dude, if your retort is to name call or this sad attempt to insert a meme, then you probably need a break from the internet. I have nothing against you, because aside from your political beliefs which are louder than aged cheese, I don’t know you. We aren’t our beliefs, since they are ever changing. You can do better to communicate.

Here’s a fun chuck Norris fact… Bruce Lee mop the floor with this clown

Walker told me I have AIDS.

Yes!

I forget this man exist but always glad when I see him again

Chuck Norris can strangle you with a cordless phone.

Was that pic taken at Joe Exotic's zoo or Antle's?

He was so proud of that joke, you can tell

Chuck Norris is a legend, they say that when he jumps into a pool he doesn't get wet, but the pool gets Chuck Norris

Chuck Norris doesn't sleep. He waits.

Is that mark cuban? Maybe I’m drunk

He's known about the memes for many years already.  You can watch him read all the internet statements about himself on camera.

Needs more filler

More like Hardware

It's like Toby knowing about Bully Maguire memes

Chuck Norris can mess up telling a Chuck Norris joke.
