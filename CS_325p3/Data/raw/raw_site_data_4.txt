Discussion | Esportsnotes of AleksiB in Havuja podcast (self.GlobalOffensive)
submitted 15 days ago * by BjorkBurr
AleksiB was in a Finnish speaking podcast called Havuja, hosted by Havus owner or manager, not sure :D anyways,  here are some interesting tidbits:
He had just landed in Australia, when he got the info of S1mple not joining them. There was no time for a emergency sub or an academy player to join.
The team is feeling good about their results in CS2
Biggest problem in G2 were the roles, players were in the wrong roles and there were communication problems.
Bad vibes kind of started from losing Katowice, and they didn't get along with the coach. Adds that the management and coach have the most influence in the team.
Felt like he was stepping on toes, when he tried to take charge. Acknowledges that he didn't call or play well. He started to play better and be more positive on comms after the team let him know he was on the chopping block.
Interviewer asks him about online rumours that Niko hates him, Aleksi says that he has a good relationship with Niko, and all the G2 guys.
Comments that NiP is a legit org 'in a certain way', adds that it was a rollercoaster
When he came into the NiP team, there were previously existing 'fights', but he doesn't want to use that word because it wasn't that bad, but can't find other words to describe it.
Doesn't go into details, but says the way he found about getting removed from NiP was horrible
Says NiPs problems can't be fixed by roster moves
With s1mple he had the first experienced awper since Allu in ENCE
says s1mple is the GOAT of CSGO.
coming months are going to be absolute grind with NaVi, nothing else
Bootcamps with the NaVi squad are fun, in the sense that all of them just grind and are on the same page about work ethic.
He knows who replaces S1mple, obviously doesn't reveal him.
I think this was filmed a month or more ago, but the interviewer asks him what he thinks about CS2. He says CSGO was in a perfect state, and is annoyed by constant new things like changing jumpthrowbinds or something like that. Doesn't say he dislikes or likes it, but says that there's a long way to go for CS2. Doesn't like that they removed certain console commands and 128-tick. 'looks better, and everything else is worse.'
Says that Valve polished CSGO for 10 years to be perfect, and then rushed the release of CS2.
Hasn't really played GTA games since San Andreas. 
For many players, now is the best time to make a comeback. Or then grind, and make a name for yourself. Example is 9ine.
Interviewer asks him about his favourite org he has played for, he says OG for international and Havu/ENCE for Finnish. OG had great vibes, he is bummed that most of his tenure was during covid, and they didn't reach the lineups potential.
Also they talk about Finnish scene, but the post is already long and most of you don't care about finnish scene, even finns don't so I won't bother typing. If you have any questions, ask away. I'll do my best to clarify and answer.

Thank you for taking the time to do this man.

[–]BjorkBurr[S] 210 points211 points212 points 15 days ago (7 children)
No worries! He never does any podcasts, especially not in English so I though this was necessary. I think he was friends with the interviewer, and some of the chatter made it feel like he did it as a favour too.

[–]Pekonius 55 points56 points57 points 15 days ago (0 children)
They go way back. The interviewer is Lasse, the CEO of HAVU and he started the org basically just to sign this promising 5 stack playing under the name Encore and their IGL was of course Aleksib. This 5 stack went and won every single LAN in Finland for the next year, before some of the players got picked by ENCE and the rest is history.

[–]Replikant83 6 points7 points8 points 15 days ago (0 children)
Thanks. Great guy and I hope he finds some success!

[+]CautiousControl7881 9 points10 points11 points 15 days ago (4 children)
He did another interview with the Havu guys a couple years ago, think it was when he was still in OG.  But it's a bit harder having to read subtitles the entire time instead of being able to listen to it (since I don't know Finnish) so this makes it a lot easier.  Thanks for posting the main points from the interview!

[–]Pekonius 5 points6 points7 points 15 days ago (1 child)
Theres the car ride episode with Lasse as well from when Aleksib joined G2

[+]CautiousControl7881 2 points3 points4 points 15 days ago (0 children)
Yeah that's the one I was thinking of, it must have been right after he left OG and joined G2.

True but sometimes I like to listen to podcasts in the background and without reading subtitles I don't get anything from the video.

[–]rionidas 126 points127 points128 points 15 days ago* (1 child)
Thank you a lot for the write up. Was actually good interview with lots good insight.
Just a couple things to add:
- He said that in G2 it just didnt click with that line-up as they could not find proper roles and as mentioned he did not have a good fit with coach 
- He felt lots of pressure at G2, and this was his first time really in this kind of situation where everyone expected you to win. Felt it affected his individual performance and calling.
- One thing he mentioned was new both in G2 and NiP was that he did not really have any say to roster moves. 
- He was schoked when G2 finally informed of the benching as he thought it was good lineup. But at NiP he was kind of relieved after he was benched
And one correction, I think that he mentioned of the NiP line-up that at his time it was not possible to save the line up with one change and speculated that more changes would be needed as they are doing now.

Second time we hear about pre-existing fights in NiP after Hampus mentioned people holding grudges which just leaves a few possibilities:
Grudges between Rez, Brollan, and/or Es3tag.

[–]Hubertos94 56 points57 points58 points 15 days ago (3 children)
I think that Konfig had problems with Hampus. After the decision of benching Hampus, Konfig was posting daily stories on IG about great day on bootcamp etc.

Es3tag was on the roster when aleksi joined and rez was awping

[–]saatan4 -2 points-1 points0 points 14 days ago (0 children)
Aleksi and k0nfig did play in NiP at the same time and he probably didn't mean the players but the management having issues.

[–]joarke 27 points28 points29 points 15 days ago (0 children)
Do the fights have to be between players? The quote about their problems not being possible to fix with roster moves kinda points towards the org/management rather than the players.

[–]gunnarsen 3 points4 points5 points 15 days ago (0 children)
Considering they benched es3tag, then brollan and es3tag came back, I it may have had to do with brollan. Only if the roster moves were aimed at getting the conflicts out of the lineup

[–]BjorkBurr[S] 4 points5 points6 points 15 days ago (4 children)
Maybe Konfig as well, he hasn't got the cleanest reputation.

[–]rudy-_- 21 points22 points23 points 15 days ago (3 children)

That's right. That time in NiP is like a fever dream to be honest.

Didn't Konf1g tweet something about aleksi's calls in a major? "Trusting the individuals more than the setups/calls" or something? 
Maybe I am remembering it wrong

[–]Akkrecoma 1 point2 points3 points 13 days ago (0 children)
It was the reverse; "Didn't trust the individuals, only the stratbook" or the like. He said it all in an interview to HLTV, like a well-minded professional does. In Twitter he only walked back the statements.

[–]Darkoplax 64 points65 points66 points 15 days ago (17 children)
Thanks for translation, this is a cool interview to see his thoughts on his time in G2 ... he really didnt get along with xtqzz as previously mentioned

That's a non-statement though. 
Not saying it isn't true just that you couldn't expect any serious player to publicly say they felt better with their previous IGL even if it was true.

He wasnt the right IGL for G2 anyway  not compatible play Styles... They also defended Hooxi when they wanted to bench Him

[–]omkar_T7 5 points6 points7 points 15 days ago (5 children)
What has XTQZZ achieved as a coach in his career for him to be revered in the community anyway? Seriously Vitality, g2 even tsm. If it wasn’t for zywoo and big names in g2 he comes no where near in the conversation of a T1 coach.

[–]VShadow1 31 points32 points33 points 15 days ago (3 children)
It's really hard if not impossible to properly evaluate the impact of a coach so people tend to extrapolate from signs. Vitality with him was the only roster to make a 6-man lineup work (granted nobody else really tried) and when they swapped IGL's to Apex who was not very experienced with that role they did not skip a beat. 
Also, worth mentioning Vitality hired him as an Analyst leading up to the major because they wanted help with tactics which is also when the roster became the best team in the World.
At the end of the day it is all just guesswork though.

[–]omkar_T7 -4 points-3 points-2 points 15 days ago (2 children)
All guesswork without any achievements to show for it. Don’t you think after a certain period of time a coaches performance should be evaluated based on the team’s success? Vitality and g2 both have found success after he left. He is simply not a T1 coach and people here need to accept that. I got downvoted to hell when i mentioned this on the tsm post.

[–]VShadow1 7 points8 points9 points 15 days ago (1 child)
Vitality also had success while he was there, and he was working with a completely different roster. G2 was still a very good team with him and he was working with Jackz instead of JKS. TSM was never going to be good with that roster.

[+]omkar_T7 comment score below threshold-9 points-8 points-7 points 15 days ago (0 children)
For a team that vitality was and the individuals they had they underperformed for the most.

[–]ju1ze 6 points7 points8 points 15 days ago (0 children)
he won trophies and his team reached top1. if its not tier1 idk what is.
If it wasn’t for zywoo and big names in g2
can be said about almost any successful coach.  also zywoo initially became top1 under him.

it's like when you kick the toxic man-child in your MM games and suddenly you start to play better. environment is important for your mental in CS.

[+]omkar_T7 comment score below threshold-16 points-15 points-14 points 15 days ago (2 children)
There is a huge difference though. That toxic child was carrying you in mm and winning you games you shouldn’t have. Now that he is gone it’s all good dandy, everyone’s laughing, having fun and although you lose against the same tough teams you won before “you played good”. But outsiders can see through your bullshit

[–]TerrorToadx 5 points6 points7 points 15 days ago* (1 child)
Or they start playing better because the team atmosphere is better? Your playstyle can totally change from how you want to play if you have someone toxic on your team, making you doubt yourself and make mistakes you otherwise wouldn't have.
How is this so hard for you to understand? Lol

I mean C9 right now are also looking better with sh1ro - a top 3-4 player in the last 3 years - benching himself. Maybe a change of scenery can be good for both parties, w0nderful is a great replacement on paper at least.

[–]Electronic-Archer720 4 points5 points6 points 15 days ago* (0 children)
But sh1ro left before played with a real IGL instead of elec and Hobbit
Really bad decisión from sh1ro i think

[–]omkar_T7 0 points1 point2 points 15 days ago (0 children)
C9 has played 4 games with boombl4 so it’s too soon to tell how they are doing. Also these few months are teams transitioning to cs2 and imo it’s hard to judge how well they will do in the near future. The break is good for s1mple since he is finding it hard to awp in the game. We have yet to see how w0nderful will perform in cs2 and only time will tell

[–]Hubertos94 6 points7 points8 points 15 days ago (0 children)
Simple GOAT of csgo - Yes
Simple the best player right now - NOPE.

How is s1mple, the best player in the team being benched is a good thing for the team?

[–]TerrorToadx 9 points10 points11 points 15 days ago (0 children)
They can still become better as a team even if they lose their most talented individual.
As I recall, Mouz got better when Niko left because his calling was selfish and he took up a lot of space on the team. When he left they started working better together as a team.

[–]afk420k 8 points9 points10 points 15 days ago (1 child)
He was toxic and ruined the environment in the team for at least a year, lol? Because of him NAVI lost so many rounds in the last months??? The last 3 matches against MOUZ were lost because simple couldn't handle his tantrum.
NAVI played 4v5 against FAZE and still won mirage 13-4 (!!!) https://www.hltv.org/matches/2367253/natus-vincere-vs-faze-iem-sydney-2023
https://www.hltv.org/stats/matches/mapstatsid/164549/faze-vs-natus-vincere
Now imagine NAVI with a decent awper instead of the last second substitute (NAVI's coach blade), i think NAVI had a great chance of winning again over FAZE and instead of FAZE winning everything in CS2... NAVI could have a slice of the CS2 pie.
No idea how you "missed" all these things if you watched NAVI's games.

S1mple missing out sidney was akin to a legendary story from the Finnish scene, when a Finnish team was traveling to a LAN in Europe and went to pick up one of their players in the morning of their flight, the player opened the door in a bath robe and said he's not coming. The team then had to scramble for an emergency substitute. They are not naming said player though. Finnish scene is known for minced meat and bathrobes at this point.

Yeah, I don't understand his behaviour. I'm pretty convinced it's the worst internet troll.

I’m just saying I’m a fan of a pro gamer. I don’t know what these people are upset about. 
Dude is great at the game, and I hope he’s got a supportive group around him.

I said I am a fan of Aleksib
You are weird

[–]Longdingleberry -3 points-2 points-1 points 15 days ago (0 children)
Are you kids down voting me because I’m a fan? 
This is fucking strange for one. But as a grown man, trying to look out for another grown man?  You kids keep doing your thing.
Aleksib, I see you man. I’m old school , and I am a huge fan. I’m not trying to call you out, I just see it in your eyes brother. 
Hopefully you know that you’re not just a cs player
