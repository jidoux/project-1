DiscussionHiko on the cheating situation (clips.twitch.tv)
submitted 4 days ago by Hypno98
Post a comment!

[–]TacticalEstrogenCS2 HYPE 805 points806 points807 points 4 days ago (85 children)
I've quite literally already run into a cheater who was jerking himself off on his steam profile because Hiko called him out on stream.
The cheaters are plentiful and they are some of the most downright degenerate human beings you'll ever run into.

[–]EnvironmentalPeak614 411 points412 points413 points 4 days ago (71 children)
There is an entire subreddit dedicated to cs cheaters. Someone posted there not long ago calling them out and the comments were something like “we do this to watch you losers cry” these people are actually terrible people with no empathy. They are deranged, malicious people.

[–]Mraz565CS2 HYPE 87 points88 points89 points 4 days ago (14 children)
There was/is an entire discord server dedicated towards cheating against streamers, like fl0m.

[–]Daunn 28 points29 points30 points 4 days ago (9 children)
Would be fun to just get inside one and pop some links to malware and fuck them up from inside
Idk how manageable that would be, but just thinking about it sounds entertaining to me lmao

It wont work tho. Most cheaters get it from a well known website BECAUSE people do that already/have done it to mess w cheaters.

[–]Iuseredditnow 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago (0 children)
Yep there is a YouTube channel where he fucks with cheaters by making the cheats fuck up their games by making them molly themselves and stuff like that. It actually pretty funny. I don't have the link right now but search up "csgo messing with cheaters with fake cheats" something like that and it will show up on youtube. I don't think he has done it since csgo, but I haven't looked recently. His fake cheats didn't break their computer since that wouldn't probably be a good idea to post on YouTube but he should make it so it does fuck their shit up. It's to that point it's needed. If valve won't fix it the community can.

[–]Manixxz 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (1 child)
Yeah, this might be the only real option to curb their spread. When they're afraid that a cheat might potentially brick their computer and do lasting damage, they'll think twice about downloading cheats.

[–]Iuseredditnow 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago* (0 children)
Even though this solution sucks I think it would make them more afraid to just cheat constantly. I support it. They have no remorse for wasting people time in the game I will have no remorse for their pc being bricked.

[–]DONNIENARC0 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (0 children)

Some guy made a video series where he published fake CSGO hacks that fuck with the user by doing things like randomly rebinding their movement keys or their drop weapon button. 
The people that fall for that kinda thing are probably a little different than the ones hanging out in official cheater discords, but it's still pretty hilarious. One of them cancels their plant/defuse at the very last second and plays a fake sound to make them think it actually went off, too.

The favt that valve went with AI is no brainer. They saw the next best fps multiplayerbin COD. Loved how cod did it (which barely did anything) and still get money.
Valve just went ai to ditch work and get paid. They know they are in the wrong and will just wait it out. Wont change unless community tells em hard with consequences.

[–]Mraz565CS2 HYPE 10 points11 points12 points 4 days ago (2 children)
Didn't cod place invisible bots/models around the map that only cheaters could see thus proving they cheat?
I don't play nor keep up with cod content, so I could be way off.

[–]BeepIsla 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago (0 children)
Minecraft servers have been doing that for years and cheats can kinda know who is a real player and who is a fake player

Barely work lol.. wallers and stuff still reign supreme

[–]Sgt-Colbert 179 points180 points181 points 4 days ago (40 children)
I’ve been saying this for years. Cheaters are mentally ill.
If you get fun and enjoyment out of making other people miserable, you’re a sociopath.
In kindergarten, you would be going around destroying other kids’ sandcastles. And you haven’t matured above that level basically.

[–]Floripa95 64 points65 points66 points 4 days ago (4 children)
And people that have that kind of mentality get punched in the face in real life, which is a learning moment. That doesn't happen on the internet, so they never learn

[–]Sgt-Colbert 21 points22 points23 points 4 days ago (2 children)
Yeah imagine cheating at a poker game in real life.

[–]Dashramos 16 points17 points18 points 4 days ago (1 child)
As someone who definetly wasnt employed by a group that was definetly not linked to any large casino. Whos specific job was to make sure that future cheaters were "deterred" from cheating again. I can tell you, it doesnt end well when cheating in real life

maybe not "ill" but definitely deranged to believe they are something they are not.

[–]ctzu 7 points8 points9 points 4 days ago (0 children)
Hell no, being a cunt is not a mental illness. Mentally ill people need help and should get it, cheaters should just be castrated.

[+]Termodynamicslad comment score below threshold-6 points-5 points-4 points 4 days ago* (1 child)
Cheaters are mentally ill.  
If you get fun and enjoyment out of making other people miserable, you’re a sociopath.
Its not that deep, people can find fun ruining the fun of others, like when you're playing uno and you team up on a guy giving him all +4 on purpose, or pulling a prank on someone and trolling. There is even a word for this is in  German, Schadenfreude. This is certified reddit psychiatrist moment.
Ultimately for the cheater none of this matters because "its just a game" for them. They do it simply because they can and they like the power trip and the act of getting away with it, no different than the duping delight people from all ages get when they cheat on a school or college test and get away with it. Pleasure after doing something nasty is very much not a mental illness. Its the same as cheating your partner, there are people who like doing it, knowing its wrong, knowing it will cause huge amount of sorrow. Saying its a mental illness removes part of their responsibility. No, they know full well what they are doing. They have a character defect.
Do not get riled up with it because as soon as the game is over they already forgot about you, while they are on your head while you're trying to unload your frustration by pointing out they have mental issues.

[–]boofheadfred 10 points11 points12 points 3 days ago (0 children)
"its just a game" for them
It is quite literally just a game. None of what happens in a Premier game really matters. It's very frustrating having your limited leisure time wasted by a cheater, but none of this matters in the end. There is no money to be gained or lost, no real life respect or social status, it's all just a game.

[+]6jeewon comment score below threshold-17 points-16 points-15 points 4 days ago (28 children)
There are more rational ways to explain the behaviors of cheaters. Yes some cheaters are going to be mentally ill but it's kind of wild to say that about all cheaters considering how many of them there are. It makes sense for someone frustrated at not being good to look for shortcuts even if they need to break the rules. Cheating exists in all things and while it's wrong you don't call everyone who cheats mentally ill.

[–]innocentrrose 20 points21 points22 points 4 days ago (11 children)
Sounds like cheater cope.
Bottom line is if you find enjoyment out of others suffering, you have antisocial personality disorder, which is a mental illness.

[–]Termodynamicslad -1 points0 points1 point 4 days ago* (0 children)
Bottom line is if you find enjoyment out of others suffering, you have antisocial personality disorder, which is a mental illness.
Suddenly you diagnosed everybody that laughs at pranks is mentally ill.
Certified reddit moment.
Waiting for all your Medical degree and diagnosis of all those people justifying why Schadenfreude is a mental disease and not you massively overreacting about something that makes you angry.
Yes, cheating is bad, but those people are just assholes, they know full well what they're doing, they don't need a mental illness to make them do what they do.

I think you can compare it to a bodybuilder using steroids: experiencing a level of power previously unattainable for you.

A bodybuilder can inject whatever he wants into his body, it won't affect other people's muscles. That's the big difference

It is what it is :)

[–]Sgt-Colbert 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (3 children)
you don't call everyone who cheats mentally ill
Actually, that's exactly what I'm doing and here's why.
First lets establish the following, everyone who cheats knows it's wrong. That's a fact. And they know that they are going to ruin the game for at least 5 (if their own team has competitive integrity, 9) people.
So by knowingly ruining the game for 5-9 people, they either have no conscience, which makes them a sociopath.
OR
They don't know that they are ruining the game for everyone else, which makes them a psychopath.
So you tell me, how not everyone who cheats has some, albeit low form, of mental illness.

[–]6jeewon 9 points10 points11 points 4 days ago (1 child)
Steamworks did a pretty good presentation in which they identified 5 broad categories of cheaters.
Achievers: People who needed to win at all costs.
Griefers: Where sadism was the fun.
Casuals: People who found the game too challenging and wanted to make it easier.
Vigilantes: Who used cheats to avenge cheating done to them.
Followers: Perceive rampant cheating in their game but want to play it still, so cheat to level the field.
They indicated that the majority of cheaters were casual cheaters. They don't necessarily want to ruin other peoples experience but have been frustrated by losing the game consistently. So they turn to cheats to enjoy it once more and level out a skill imbalance.

[+]kitsunegoon comment score below threshold-6 points-5 points-4 points 4 days ago (0 children)
That still requires a severe lack of empathy. 
Also I think there's a 6th type who cheats for monetary reasons both people who cheat at a high level and people who boost. These people have the least deranged reason as it's like the whole stealing bread to feed your family. 
They're still pieces of shit, and idc if you're broke and got no bitches go do construction or something smh my head broke ass third world headass no rubles headass 操你妈。仆街冚家鏟。

[–]JSP777 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)
The  other things people usually cheat at have completely different dynamics, higher risks and real rewards. You can cheat at tests to get better grades, you risk being expelled from school. You cheat with your taxes, the reward is wealth and the risk is going to prison. Whilst cheating in cs, you risk basically nothing and your only reward is other people's suffering. People who cheat at maths tests are not sociopaths, but people who cheat in video games are.

[–]6jeewon 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)
I see where a lot of people are coming from, but I feel like the attitude towards cheaters is so hostile and it's not productive to helping cheaters become legit players. But if that's just the way it is that's fine. I was just speaking what I believe it true.

[–]weirdguy133wq 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (1 child)
There more thank just one reason people cheat. Some does it only for the advantage, they might enjoy the crying, but they usually start it because A other cheaters 2 to get an advantage.   
What I will say, is that right now is just waiting before a ban wave. I do think VAC should be a lot better, but bans usually come in waves, cause that is harder to deal with, if you haven an anti cheat that isnt kernal. Pirate software talked about this from the time he was working at WoW anti cheat. It makes it harder to combat as it can be multiple things

[–]Manixxz 14 points15 points16 points 4 days ago (0 children)
From my over 15 years of experience with online shooters, I noticed that most cheaters are either overly entitled and/or spoiled people who think they deserve to have an advantage over others, or they're people with low empathy who have trouble putting themselves in other people's shoes. Those two types seem to cover the majority of shared cheater personality traits.

Not at all, they post new cheats, ask questions about fixing cheats, what’s the best free cheats, etc….

Hate to be the one to welcome you to the internet but everyone here is deranged and malicious and the most realistic solution is to not cry so they’ll go ruin someone else’s game to get them to cry since you aren’t entertaining them enough.

Getting a lot of attention on tiktok live thats for sure. Hackers are  live streaming with 5k views of mad spectators getting super triggered.

[–]Patient_Apartment415 31 points32 points33 points 4 days ago (7 children)
Who cares if they get any attention or not. At the end of the day, you invest the time to play a game that gets ruined by a cheater. If it happened rarely, noone would be complaining, but  on top of all the other issues Premier has, cheaters completely ruin it to the point where no high level player would seriously play it even if everything except for VAC was perfect.
It's just not worth the time. They had a golden opportunity because everyone wanted matchmaking that doesn't require you to install additional software and matchmake on a third party client, but they fucked up. At this point everyone's already over Premier and noone's coming back until they fix the cheating issue.

[–]TKYooHCS2 HYPE 9 points10 points11 points 4 days ago (6 children)
What are you on dude? No one brought that up in this comment thread. They were just talking what gets cheaters’ hard.

[–]Patient_Apartment415 -3 points-2 points-1 points 4 days ago (5 children)
Yeah and I replied that from my standpoint it's absolutely irrelevant what gets or doesn't get cheaters hard.
I invest my time into Valve's product. If there's like a solid 30% chance I'll have a cheater in my Premier match, then I don't think it's worth investing time into that product.
The only way for Valve to maybe (not even this is guaranteed) get their head out of their asses would be if vast majority of players quit Premier. Not just pros or high rank players, but everyone. If their Premier player count drops by like 70-80%, they'd most definitely have to do something about it.
And let's not forget that even if we exclude cheaters, Premier is borderline unplayable if you don't have a 5 stack.

[+]Gawdsauce 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)
And you're not wrong. Cheaters don't give a shit whether you get upset or not. They cheat to win, end of story. The only thing that pisses a cheater off, is consequences or losing. They forget about you the second the match is over.

[–]ad49se 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (3 children)
I dont understand your pov at all. You should care that cheaters get attention. You should care that TikTok don’t have a policy where they permanently ban people that are livestreaming when they’re flat-out hacking in games. If we all didn’t care, we wouldn’t change shit.

[–]Patient_Apartment415 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (2 children)
Breaking news for you kid, but scumbags always got attention in every sphere of life. Cheaters in something as irrelevant as videogames are insignificant in that regard.
I give absolutely zero fucks what's happening on tiktok.
The only way to actually make a change is for people to boycott inedequate products. Not just Premier matchmaking in this case, but bad products in general.
I don't care if a cheater I faced gets 1 or 100k views on social media. He ruined my game and Valve did nothing about it. That's all that counts for me.

Seems insanely dumb to have so much trust in an AI that can't even correctly pin point if someone is just spinning fast or actually spinbotting.

[–]Hypno98[S] 71 points72 points73 points 4 days ago (58 children)
The thing is in theory AI AC seems like a slam dunk, there wouldn't be a need to spend time playing the cat and mouse game that AC devs are forced to endure currently.
The problem is that like any AI, AI AC is a black box where you basically have no clue how it trully works making debugging it basically impossible. You don't know what triggers it and what doesn't, you just have to trust that the system is accurate and when it isn't you have no way of knowing if it was a false positive or not.

[–]jetvermillion 29 points30 points31 points 4 days ago (22 children)
The training data is supposedly from the Overwatch days, at least according to this
It is true neural networks are pretty abstract when you're trying to examine what it's learned, but it is possible to make inferences based on adjusting training data and seeing how it behaves accordingly
The larger issue seems to be that cheating is (obviously) on a spectrum. If every cheater were spinbotting and landing instant headshots, that's easy to pick up. Anything short of that, where people are toggling on/off, using less aggressive aimbot settings, or intentionally doing things to throw off suspicion, it gets very difficult. Whatever the anti cheat is learning, you would also want that to be relatively obscure so that cheaters and developers of cheats don't also learn how to game the system.
I think Riot took the smarter approach honestly. Their invasive anticheat is extremely annoying and requires you to disable important OS level things you might need like virtualization, but the tradeoff is that in 99% of valorant games, you can be assured no one is hacking. When I played CSGO at its peak, it felt like at least 20% of the games had suspicious players.

[–]Hypno98[S] 5 points6 points7 points 4 days ago (21 children)
Imo AI AC will always be a pipe dream
Even the most advanced AIs can be "cheesed" into doing stuff they aren't suppose to ( jailbreaking with chatgpt ) or render them completely useless at a task they appear to master ( alphago losing to an inexperienced player as long as they stick to an unorthodox strategy ).
AI AC also comes with the downside of not being able to rectify false positives.
Nothing will ever beat a well financed dedicated AC team.

I wonder how AI AC would react to players like flusha - people that practice and constantly spam wallbangs and smokes and having success.

[–]jetvermillion 3 points4 points5 points 4 days ago (0 children)
Best case scenario, common wallable spots (which were plentiful in the 1.6 days) won't be useful in distinguishing cheater vs non cheater. AI AC would need to pick up on more obscure spots

[–]Hypno98[S] -1 points0 points1 point 4 days ago (0 children)
From my personal experience of having cheaters wallbang headshot me from bathroom to playground on Overpass with an auto sniper I would say it wouldn't see anything wrong

[–]jetvermillion 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago* (0 children)
I'm assuming vacnet isn't learning in real time because it needs labeled instances of cheaters vs non cheaters. This should hopefully mean there is enough data sanitation along the process to mitigate any attempts to cheese the system. False positives might also be less of an issue than false negatives - Valve was pretty hilarious and smart in their solution to pit low trust factor players against each other rather than banning them out right (which comes with higher risks)
I had a random idea with adversarial networks, which led me to this project with an interesting approach. I do agree though, AI AC does not seem very promising. Well, it could work, but it feels like it will require an insane amount of data and work to accomplish something a ring 0 anti cheat could do

[–]fredy31 3 points4 points5 points 4 days ago (4 children)
To me it would be easy; have some actions give you 'Sus points'. Wall bangs headshots; games with 80-90% HS%, huge win streaks, blowing games up with a 40k, etc.
Have some people, just a team of 5-10, and they just look the top "sus point" scores. Look at their latest demos. If they hack, nuke the account.
FFS valve pulls, depending what stats you look at, somewhere like 9 figures a year just via cases; They have the cashflow to put down a small team that looks at demos 40 hours a week and vet the cheaters from the non cheaters and at least make a dent in the problem.

[–]SarcasmGPT 13 points14 points15 points 4 days ago* (0 children)
Let's see, be cheap and spend a million a year, 50k for a job you can do at home, that's 20 people so 4 teams of 5 working 40 hours. You'd expect them to ban at least one every 10 minutes, or one person to ban one every 50 minutes, especially if you're looking at the most egregious, that's  960 cheaters banned every week. 49,920 per year.  That would put a healthy dent in it. At least at the highest levels. Once they can't reach the highest levels that's going to have an extra effect. Expand that out beyond spending a million and you can basically solve the cheating problem. 
They make 54 million a month in cases, if they spent about 1% of that to stop cheating, they'd have the ability to ban 323,000 players a year. 
1% of their revenue in cases would put a massive dent in the cheating problem. 
They don't even keep the top 100 clean.
That's how much they fucking care.

They specifically mentioned ML which to me at least implies AI in training. For which it requires lots of data. I've been down voted every time I've mentioned this but that's how it works if you want accuracy. 
And we want accuracy for automated bans, right?
This isn't just copium (unless they are lying) because that's how ML works.

This. At some point Valve has to admit defeat. I know the CEOs/executives say the same thing - after 5-6 years and having no noticeable / substantial improvement to cheating? Sorry that is a failure. If Valve was a public company -- these major issues would be priority.

Nah I don’t think so, it’s just something insanely hard to produce but it’s something worthwhile imo. I just wish they had a better client sided AC, preferably by someone that’s not valve, to go along with it so we’re not stuck in the hood while it gets good.
Who knows, my cope is that they’re putting finishing touches on the actual release of vac live and are slowly rolling it out.

[–]cneakysunt -2 points-1 points0 points 4 days ago (0 children)
I would guess the project started then along with planning for CS2. Without really knowing it's premature to presume they have been collecting data that long.
The fact is what they're proposing is a lot of work at this scale and probably fairly expensive.

[–]Snagmesomeweaves 3 points4 points5 points 4 days ago (2 children)
And the fact people think this game is just an update when it was an entire engine overhaul and other systems could be completely down or broken because of it. People would have been mad either way if they released it when they did or mad if they didn’t. Ripping the bandaid off was the better option. There is no way they don’t care about the game and they are actively fixing issues that crop up, but larger initiatives like VAC and overwatch likely need more work unfortunately. People are impatient and they would be pissed off anyway if they were still playing CSGO  posting the fridge meme with every update and “where source 2?”
TLDR, give them time to fix the whole new engine with new code and math which probably invalidated everything VAC had learned because they probably tried it.

[–]Etna- 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (1 child)
Implying VAC learned anything at all

[–]Snagmesomeweaves 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)
Technically it did learn over CSGO. I would imagine the easiest short term solution is getting reports to work and overwatch cases back. That could at least help the situation is likely easier to implement.

[–]AdakaR 6 points7 points8 points 4 days ago (1 child)
The problem with vac is not that vac is bad, it's that vac is essentially not maintained. If vac had kernel level access it would not change anything, as access without use is equally worthless as no access and no use.

[–]KittenOnHunt 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)
Exactly. They need a dedicated anti cheat team or it won't work. You can literally just download the most know ones and be fine for a long time, that shouldn't happen. The fact that "staple" cheat providers that every cs player knows aren't banned after a single day or so feels crazy, it's not like they're hidden

[–]roedtogsvart -1 points0 points1 point 4 days ago (12 children)
Nothing is a black box and you aren't debugging anything.  Do you really think the engineers who have worked on vacnet for years don't know how it works?  Just because you don't know how something works doesn't mean nobody does.
You don't know what triggers it and what doesn't, you just have to trust that the system is accurate and when it isn't you have no way of knowing if it was a false positive or not.
That's the point.  Whether or not it working well is another discussion.

[–]roedtogsvart 2 points3 points4 points 4 days ago (9 children)
Sure.  Here's an excerpt: 
This inability for us to see how deep learning systems make their decisions is known as the  “black box problem,” and it’s a big deal for a couple of different reasons. 
How do you know that Valve is unable to see how their own learning system makes decisions?  Do you know how VACNet or its data arch is structured?
The article is a general nothingburger.  It's just talking about some of the potential challenges when analyzing the output from a system like this.  Thats.. like literally what all the work is, analyzing the output.

[–]Hypno98[S] -2 points-1 points0 points 4 days ago (4 children)
If Valve knew how vac net works you really think they would've rolled out something that barely works and can't differentiates between someone spinning very fast and an actual spin bot?

If they knew how it worked it would be functional, it isn't even remotely close to that



[–]futility_jp -2 points-1 points0 points 4 days ago (3 children)
That excerpt says exactly what the problem is and answers your question. If it's still not clear then go do some reading about how neural networks work. There's nothing to argue about.

[–]roedtogsvart 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago (2 children)
The article linked says this about the problem:
But Rawashdeh says that, just like our human intelligence, we have no idea of how a deep learning system comes to its conclusions. It “lost track” of the inputs that informed its decision making a long time ago. Or, more accurately, it was never keeping track.
Do you think all machine learning functions this way?  The author is just trying to make the ideas sound as spooky as possible.  If you take that at face value, you might want to go do some reading yourself.  Again:
we have no idea of how a deep learning system comes to its conclusions
lol

[–]futility_jp 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (1 child)
Vacnet uses neural networks, it doesn't matter how other machine learning algorithms work in this context. The author is explaining a valid weakness of deep learning algorithms such as neural networks. You're just throwing verbal shit at the wall and hoping something sticks, good luck with that.



[–]Aletherr 2 points3 points4 points 4 days ago (0 children)
They actually don't know how it works, that's the whole point of deep learning. Just throw enough data on it and pray that the AI model can correctly do stuff you want it to do. Yes, you can modify the parameters and the neural network itself, but you will not know how the values on each  given parameter contributes to the final result (especially on complex models)

[–]sheikhy_jake 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)
AI model introspection isn't as totally opaque as you are making out. There are methods for learning both "what triggers it" and "what it does" on a meaningful level. It's absolutely not trivial even for reasonably modest models, but it's not like we have to just blindly train and accept the answer (though that is of course what is often done).

[–]JuKaRe 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago (1 child)
Someone is just spinning fast for so long that no legit player should have any reason to do.
It's a machine learning operation, not a super smart AI. 
What's dumb is that there's no safety net for that, AI should be able to detect that person spinbots AND kills everybody.

[–]aNteriorDudeCS2 HYPE 6 points7 points8 points 4 days ago* (0 children)
Well if it cant even differentiate between very obvious stuff like spinbots, how on earth would it ever get smart enough to detect radar hacks or DMA cheats that aren't even visible on the computer playing the game? In this day and age you definitely need something that has deeper access to ones system to truly have a cheat-free (or as close to it as possible) environment.

I haven't touched the game because of this.... the dude that proved it was repeatable still hasn't been unbanned, not touching the game until Valve reverses those false-positives and gets rid of the move mouse fast = ban crap.... Like, if I put on ttfaf and spin to it to make the homies in the discord call laugh or if I get jumpscared and fling my mouse in panic: possible ban... 
Shit like this could be triggered by anything... Like, imagine catching a ban just because of debris like cat hair/feathers (the little dude likes to chill on my mic arm above my mousepad) on your mousepad causing the mouse sensor to go crazy.... too many random innocent things could cause a ban, hell no.

Perplexing that Valve didn't seize the opportunity when releasing CS2 to fix any of counter strike's biggest challenges. It seemed so obvious,

Or hell, just have a few people nuke accounts that are at the top of the leaderboards and clearly cheating.
Like we see here, a pro shouldnt have a 90% win rate; best of them get somewhere like 70-75%.
Meanwhile you look the top ranks; 200 wins, 90-95% win rate. FFS there were even some with 100+ games and 100% wins. Just get like 10 employees, manually review them, and if they hack, nuke their accounts. Keep that leaderboard you show proudly every time i queue for a game clean.

Subtick is a really great step in the right direction. Given some time to optimize it it grants so much more accuracy and reliability. The whole game is in beta state and you expect it to be flawless.

Contrary to what most of reddit thinks, you technically could play CSGO, although not official mm servers. You can access it from steam library-CS2->properties->betas.

It really sounds quite dumb now that we've seen these two new techs being a failure. All they had to do was investing on 128 tick servers and kernel access AC (they could have even paid FaceIt to implement theirs into the game). Instead, Valve decided it was best to waste time and money in 2 flimsy new techs that have brought literally nothing but headaches to the playerbase. I was the biggest believer of CS2, really thought Valve was cooking something, but right now the game just feels less crispy and responsive than CSGO. Every match feels like a coin toss now.

[–]AdakaR 15 points16 points17 points 4 days ago (0 children)

1) you have a very loud vocal minority crying about ring0/kernel level access for no objective or rational reason
2) Valve does what Valve wants and they bet on themselves. They've wasted years developing VR and the steamdeck, VAC, subtick and their tech is not the flag ship in their respective roles. Circle is going to repeat itself with VAC net.

It isn't bullshit. Only weirdos and fearmongers care about ring 0 access. The amount of people who actually go out of their way to care about their computer privacy and security that much are less than 0.001% of counter strike players.
Majority of the programs and games on our computers already have that access.

I was okay with the idea of Source 2 just updating the graphical fidelity of the game before we knew what CS2 was… that was perfectly fine with me. But it released with less content and annoying change to ranks that I just feel like playing less. 
As someone who gave up on playing GO’s other game modes years ago I wish they revamped and made them more fun to play with CS2. Not wanting to play competitive as much really makes me want to play the other modes and unique maps (Source 2 graphics on those maps like come on..).

Got my buddy into cs2, we placed well in premiere because he play Val and used to play cs source. After a few weeks I got around 10k and started Qing with 10-12 and the matches were great. Then we had a match with two blatant cheaters, one 17k the other unrated. And there was a guy getting carried with identical 17k as the cheater. Lost to them obviously, played another game it was fine, game after that it was the same 2 cheaters and guy getting carried but this time on our team.. they recognized me for calling them out and said this time they were gonna throw lmao. My buddy and I abandoned the match and installed FaceIt. It’s all we have played since.

Yup. My friends and I only play Premier at this point if we're playing with people who refuse to get FaceIt(which is understandable for some of our more casual friends). We don't have this issue on FaceIt at all. And that's coming from someone that otherwise hates ESEA/FaceIt as an org. Its just an undeniable reality that the experience is better than Premier.
And I'd say to anyone that has cracked into the top 1000 - congrats - but the reality is it doesn't mean anything anymore when most of the good players have moved to FaceIt and have even let their Premier rating expire. I say this, not to insult anyone that has cracked the top 1000 but more to make it evident to Valve more than anyone, that their entire Premier system is busted for as long as the cheating problem in high ELO games continues.
I think Valve needs to accept that Premier will forever be a flawed system if they don't address this issue. And I say that as someone that is not the biggest fan of an intrusive anti-cheat, but I don't see what other option there is. Maybe make Premier an opt-in system where players are agreeing to intrusive anti-cheat. 
I really don't hold it against Valve for sticking to their ethics on this but so far all the evidence suggests, there's no way you can have a competitive FPS without intrusive anti-cheat. Stamp a warning on it, ask players to explicitly opt-in and be done with it. If people don't want to do it, I totally understand but then just leave them to play Competitive Match Making and they can work to get Global on all the maps for their competitive experience.

Every single thread about cheating is getting nuked under an hour. We know valve looks at forums to gage the cheating situation and the constant removal of any thread about it may very well give the impression to the devs that the problem isn't a big deal.
Hell even on this very subreddit, we get threads of people living in lala land who doubt the reporting of other players that get thousands of upvotes while any thread that exposes the problem is deleted in an hour.
Something is gotta change because the current situation is actively harming the game. Maybe there should be a weekly cheating megathread where people can post their clips so that Valve can get a real view of the problem without the subreddit being spammed by cheating clips.

The stance on cheating threads might be what the mods here do best. Cheating threads are absolute shit content. They add no value and take attention from more valuable issues. Everyone knows there's a cheating issue. Filling up the front page with cheating threads doesn't make Valve suddenly care, it just makes the sub unreadable.
Cheating posts absolutely destroyed r/codwarzone eventually. Everyone moaning and posting killcams of dying to cheaters as if their post was going to do anything of value. Barely any fun plays or analysis on the front page, just incessant "wahhh cheats"

They add no value and take attention from more valuable issues.
Tell me you're a closet cheater without telling me you're a cheater.  
Cheating is the no. 1 issue with the game at the moment and the biggest issue valve has to fix.  
If they don't, premiere will remain ruined, any improvements it brings will be irrelevant as people goback to faceit, and the whole point of subtick (not splitting the community) will be rendered pointless.  
CS2 will never succeed to the level it should as long as the anticheat is dogshit.  Valorant will continue to eat CS's lunch because their anticheat actually fucking works, and new players will continually choose it over CS for that simple reason alone.

[–]Alarming-Ad-5656 8 points9 points10 points 4 days ago (5 children)
Everyone that disagrees with me is a closet cheater.
They literally explained their point in no uncertain terms — Valve knows cheating is an issue, we know cheating is an issue. Having a bunch of threads on it won’t change their stance, it’ll just make the subreddit shit and make people leave to another one.
The only things that will actually change Valve’s mind MAYBE are people quitting the game and not buying cases. They don’t give a shit if 100% of posts are about cheating.

[–]RocketHops -4 points-3 points-2 points 4 days ago (4 children)
Having a bunch of threads to the point that the sub is nothing but cheating threads can force Valve's hand.  It gets the attention of news sites who start covering the issue and making headlines about how CS2 has a cheating issue and players are not happy.  This gets mainstream attention, and suddenly Valve has to do something because everyone is paying attention, and new players look at the mess and say "hell why would I try that game?"
If you wanna sit here and run interference for cheaters and cover for them, I don't really care if you actively have cheats on your machine or not, you're enabling them by obstructing discussion of the issue and you're part of the problem.

Cool, all we have to do is ruin the go-to place for discussion about the game, and we'll have a small chance that that will change the mind of the company that can just look at the case revenue stream to decide whether or not to do anything! I changed my mind this is a great idea.

[–]MulfordnSons -1 points0 points1 point 4 days ago (6 children)
GO did pretty okay I think no?

[–]RocketHops 4 points5 points6 points 4 days ago (5 children)
GO survived because faceit fixed the problem for valve, which is something they seemed to want to change with 2.  
However, having to use a 3rd party program is a barrier to entry for most new players that turns them off the game.  Established players are fine because that's what they've known, but if you tell a new player they can come to CS, pay $15 for prime that doesn't work, have to download a 3rd party matchmaking service and anticheat and can't play native MM, and then maybe even pay a subscription to the 3rd party service on top of that just to have a bearable experience.  
Or they can go to Valorant, which is free, has almost no cheaters because the anticheat works, no 3rd party required, the matchmaking works and is what pros play.  Most people are going w the 2nd option.

[–]MulfordnSons -1 points0 points1 point 4 days ago (4 children)
it’ll be the same as it was with GO in CS2. 
Go to Valorant, by all means! I could care less

[–]masiju 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (0 children)
purely from an user perspective: I prefer cheating posts to get nuked. 
Cheating posts provide no meaningful content that I personally can engage with. I do not care that you had a cheater in your lobby. There is nothing to talk about, nothing to marvel at. You had cheater in your game? there are cheaters in the game? So what? Why should that matter to this sub? We gonna sacrifice the quality of this sub for cheating posts that nobody cares about? seriously, if what you want to SEE on this sub is cheating posts, what is wrong with you? I understand the desire to create a vent post about cheaters, but who the fuck wants to READ those?  I know you don't. You would not fucking read "this guy was blatantly walling #14". You just want the ability to shout out your cheating complaint into the void and leave it there. I get that desire. But it would fucking ruin the sub.
Cheating posts do not solve anything: The community increasing the frequency of complaints about cheating, creating more noise on this sub, is not goint to solve the issue. it will not make valve fix the issue faster. If this sub was nothing BUT cheater complaints, valve would not fix the issue faster. If the players want to voice their concerns, aim them directly at valve. 
cheating posts encourage heated, low effort posts: the easiest type of post to make is a vent post. "Fuck i'm SO mad i'm gonna POST ON THE INTERNET" allowing cheating "discussion" would bring about an overwhelming amount of these low effort "I'm mad >:(" posts.
cheating posts encourage witch hunts and brigading: although in ragehack scenarios a cheater is easy to spot, but there's a massive (MASSIVE) gray area under which most cheating allegations fall. Most "cheaters" really are just having a good day.

It happens all the time. If Indie devs care and want to take over small subreddits for their games so they can control criticism. Then Valve almost certainly cares what happens on bigger subreddits with a lot of exposure. It's far from the first time mods have been caught taking money.

[–]tolkienbooks 11 points12 points13 points 4 days ago (1 child)

Yes exactly, valve knows about the cheating problems and are (hopefully) working on fixing it. So I don't think having x number of extra cheating posts on the subreddit will bring about a fix sooner.

They only ban when they have proof of cheating, but statistically they probably know if people are cheating with a very high level of certainty. I mean, think for a second, if an idiot like you can recognize a cheater just by like looking at a scoreboard do you really think no one on Valve can? Do you realize they got data on every single thing you do on the game? How do you think sites like Leetify get all that data?

It's because unless you have cold hard evidence someone is cheating it makes no fucking difference posting about it on this sub. A barrage of "let's talk about the cheating" posts makes no difference and just dilutes the subreddit. Half the people talking about cheaters are just getting dicked by better players. Unless you're getting rage hacked and obvious aimbotted, most of this sub has no rucking idea if they're actually playing against a hacker. 
This kind of post is fine because its about a relevant figures opinion on cheating, but the absolute barrage of "this game has a cheating problem, I face cheaters every day" is utterly pointless. Report them in game and if you have video evidence, sent it to valve. I agree a weekly thread might be good but again, discussion of it means nothing unless people show up with cold hard evidence.

You don't even need cold hard evidence to know there's a cheating problem, but you're right it makes no difference because what do the posts accomplish? It's not like Valve doesn't know there are cheaters unless it's posted on this sub, this isn't their only source into the CS community. And I don't see how more posts about cheating will make Valve work any harder on a solution because we have no idea what they're doing over there.

[–]Ok_Savings1800 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)
Mods just trying to hide how bad the cheating situation is in CS, it's all cool when you have a Deagle Ace and post it, all cool to show a new skin submission, all cool when you play a tune using the bells on Inferno...
But when it comes to cheaters - nope... Thread locked, post deleted, user banned. People face cheaters in Premier daily, almost everyone who plays 10 games in Wingman, Comp, or Premier will encounter a cheater. That's a huge deterrent from playing the game, it ruins your motivation to queue again. I think it has a lot heavier toll on how it affects a players desire to come back and play again knowing he might face another cheater and waste another 30 minutes, knowing the cheater won't be banned, and the Elo won't be restored.
A lot more than seeing a nice skin submission, a cool trick, or a frag montage.
Mods have created this safe space where cheating is a taboo, only 1% players face, and be like "I wonder if you really played a cheater, or just complaining".
Showing the state of the game for what it is should be the right approach of the sub, you can ban gambling and skin trading site posts, but other than that you have to allow the community to see and upvote whatever they choose, else you aren't really helping deal with the main issues, just creating this "clean" look for the game that may be misleading.

[–]Shhadowcaster -1 points0 points1 point 3 days ago (1 child)
This video is a complete nothing burger. He doesn't address the main issue at all outside of saying it exists. Obviously kernel level is more effective, but that just completely ignores the problem that a lot of people have with it. The threads are probably getting removed because there are a million threads about it with 0 new information or talking points. Ask for a megathread, don't sit around and constantly post the same talking points as if it's something valve doesn't already know.

Yes I wish more of these cheaters posts would get banned and removed.
It's a well known issue, well documented and there isn't anything more there needs to be said about it. More posts only add to the frustration of people trying to enjoy this sub not being anything of value. 
It's all this sub nowadays is people bitching while there are still millions of people playing the game. That's the number that truly affects valve and no amount of posts and bitching will change it if they are still one of the most played games out there.
You can cry "the game is trash" but if you continue playing it every day for multiple hours no dev is going to take that feedback seriously. Nobody is writing features and upgrades based on a subreddit either, they have their own means of monitoring stuff and don't need your ass crying "omg cheaters" for the 10000x to point to a problem. 
The only thing this cheating!!!! outpouring is doing is driving people away from this subreddit and cs community as a whole. Hence why mods are trying to get a handle on it.

You put too much power into this subreddit. Valve only skims it at best and mostly pays attention to well thought out posts with proper analysis. 
You already have Twitter and YouTube comments raging about cheaters too, with several pro players speaking on the issue. Nobody is hiding anything it's a well known issue Valve is aware of.
People playing faceit instead of premiere is the best argument you can have for fixing the issue. 
300 posts on reddit about cheaters accomplishes absolutely nothing.

[–]Dingby 5 points6 points7 points 4 days ago (3 children)
You need to show the cheating problem in its full glory, the drop in player numbers would force valves hand. It should be there number 1 issue and have the most people working on it. But it is probably not even on a list.
Hiding the issue does not help in the slightest.

Not everybody. Some of us have been around the block for a while and understand that intrusive anticheats are some of the only actually effective ones.
A ton of people complained and bitched about it and had all these conspiracy theories because of Tencent but at the end of the day their anticheat is god damn effective, and people like me called it from the start.
If only people would educate themselves maybe public perception of intrusive anticheats could have reached Valve's ears. In an alternate timeline maybe VAC would actually be good.

And thats before opening the can of worms that a bunch of other drivers have that kernel.access.

Is it though? You can’t really take the moral high ground unless you exclusively play Valve MM and buy skins on the Steam market.
If you have more than 1000 hours you for sure have given the Saudis the same access a long time ago. Not to mention the 3rd party gambling and trade sites located in tax havens.

i've got £2k worth of games in my steam account stretching back 20 years (not tradeable inventory items that can be hocked to another account at a moment's notice), that's all the information valve need to link me with similar players to provide me with an almost entirely cheater free experience.
as for the "new player experience", trust factor is already a thing (supposedly). an account like mine should have some fucking AMEX gold card private washroom tier S+++++ trust factor and shouldn't be going anywhere near the dudes with level 1 steam accounts used purely for CS2 that i'm constantly facing.
if valve's anti-cheat is too shit to be an effective hard counter, then soft counters like utilising your entire steam history to determine your trust factor need to made far more aggressive.

I swear trust factor is entirely different.

valve knows my name, my credit card details, the thousands of £ i've spent on games and the thousands of hours i've spent playing them, all through the same account for multiple decades. 
i reckon the majority of players are in a vaugely similar situation to me, or at least enough to create a very healthy player pool of people who are extremely unlikely to be cheaters. meanwhile a small percentage burn through accounts with no respectable purchase history (beyond transferrable skins) like wildfire.
if they can't stop people cheating, then they should make every effort to mitigate the chance that historically certified legitimate players aren't mixing with potential risk cases.

[–]emraaa 4 points5 points6 points 3 days ago (0 children)
Wouldn't this basically kill the game for most new players. You won't be able to have a healthy player base if every new player is thrown to the wolves.

[–]SnapShotKoala 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago (0 children)
Just do KYC, if you have shared your credit card info with them then an extra security step would be confirming your identity. That way your person would be linked to the account fully, uploading a pic of your passport or drivers license. 
Personally I have been using steam for nearly 20 years and I wouldn't have much problem doing this. I know it would massively increase trust among players.
Similar to how its done in Korea where game accounts are tied to your social security number or something. I remember having to buy / rent one to make an account on a Korean MMO a long time ago.

[–]OlBillyB 8 points9 points10 points 4 days ago (0 children)
I've got £10 worth of games in my steam account because I only play cs please don't match me with cheaters. With that said you're right, a 15 yrs old steam account with over 10k hours in cs should have a bigger impact on your trust factor, assuming it does work.

[–]Zarrex 3 points4 points5 points 4 days ago (1 child)
an account like mine should have some fucking AMEX gold card private washroom tier S+++++ trust factor and shouldn't be going anywhere near the dudes with level 1 steam accounts used purely for CS2 that i'm constantly facing.
exactly lol, my 5 stack of friends has like 25k or 30k combined hours with hundreds of steam games and 10+ year old accounts, why am I being matched with someone who just created a steam account yesterday and is somehow 24k elo

[–]Iochara 2 points3 points4 points 4 days ago (0 children)
This is why I stopped playing premier. My Steam account is 12 years old, has over 170 games, I played CS:GO since 2016, 1.6 since 2011, had 1700 wins in CS:GO, have Steam profile level 218, I've never cheated in any game, etc. So, you'd think to the trust factor algorithm, my account shouldn't look so suspicious that I should be continuously matched against people on suspiciously new accounts with suspiciously high rating that are obviously cheating.
The last straw was when I had two games in a row, that constituted the end of a 6 loss streak to cheaters. On the first one, my stack matched up against a guy who was in the top 100 NA, and he had one guy on his team who could just hold W, hit headshots, and basically 1v5 us, while the guy with top-100 tier elo would crouch in the same corner in lobby or trophy (Nuke) with a shotgun every round, and when we prefired him because he was legitimately there every round, he and his whole team would call cheats. This game ended in an agonizing OT tie, only reason we got close was because it was literally a 1v5, there was 1 cheater and 4 people with no hands. The next game was a 5-stack of Chinese players who we weren't entirely sure about on CT, but then when we switched to T, they would stack all 5 players wherever we were going. It was frustrating. Normal competitive isn't much better either, especially when you get near what seems to be the current rank peak (MGE/DMG). It's genuinely made me enjoy casual more than competitive, which I'd never thought I'd say.

[–]Goliath_11 2 points3 points4 points 4 days ago (0 children)
exactly this, i am always perplexed by why they never think of using our steam history/stats.............
IDK about trust factor for me , i am never toxic, always calm and nice even on the shittiest matches and shittiest teammates......... I have 13 year old account , been playing csgo since 2014, thousands of hours, thousands of matches, have alot of different games... yet i get a dude with level 1 account, 1 game, 84 hours who is ranked global and blatantly wallhacking the fuck out of the game... this shit happens alot....... I know there are cheaters with expensive profiles or legit looking profiles/stolen....... but they are not as frequent as the new accounts...... it is ridiculous

[–]innocentrrose 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)
Love that description and couldn’t agree more. The amount of time and money I have spent on my steam account, I should be getting treated well. The least they could do is not match me against new accounts because them cheating is one thing, the other thing is new players aren’t fun for anyone unless they’re a friend of mine,

Are we sure trust factor is actually implemented yet? Because there is no indication it is right? In csgo, since we had trust factor I had 1!

Mods, just make a sticky about people reporting cheaters. Allow us to record these people we see and use it as a way for Valve to see how bad it is. It’s IGNORANT that you guys keep removing these types of posts if you’re not going to make a sticky discussion.

[–]Ciderlini 48 points49 points50 points 4 days ago (8 children)
I can recall one blatant cheater in playing valorant for the past two years. 
I had one blatant cheater on the other team last week and one blatant cheater on my team already this week. 
This is not complicated. Fucking valve.

[–]bricktown11 31 points32 points33 points 4 days ago (2 children)
This is honestly the easiest summarization of the cheating problem. I played Valorant from beta up til a year or so ago. High elo/immortal player pushing for radiant etc. I probably saw a blatant hacker 2 or 3 teams in 1000+ games.
I have had steam since 2003 and have competed at multiple international LANs for various versions on CS. Im not a pro but i know and play with pros you have heard of. 
In CS2 im seeing blatant cheaters every session at around 15k right now. 
I wish people would stop hiding behind the fact that the problem might be slightly exaggerated or the fact that many have no clue what they are talking about. There are a LOT of cheaters. Iv got 100 anecdotes but you have all heard them before. I had one game where there might have been 6 cheaters in the lobby, including my team. Felt like i was in the matrix watching these rejects try to pretend like they were legit. These experiences do lead to placebo effects but the fact that there are cheaters everywhere remains.

[–]extraleet500k Celebration 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago* (1 child)
Since 3-4 years in less then every 4 games someone got later vac banned, I have prime, I never cheated and I don't play with cheaters. But every post about this problem in this forum just get removed.

I honestly had a better experience at global MM in GO than at 15k+ in CS2. I dont know how this is even possible, but it is. Around 20% of my games have cheaters in them, and those are only the rage hackers.

I mean players like these have probably never touched a multiplayer game other than CS in the last decade. And suddenly people start hyping up this new game saying it'll kill their game that they have so many memories of. They try the game and hate it obviously (because its not exactly the same game that they play), they also complain about the new game being a "ripoff".
It's just an emotion thing that happens everytime, right now it happened with CS and OW players against Val, and in a decade when the 15y/o kids who are playing Val right now grow up, it'll happen to them too.

[–]BridgeNew9457 -1 points0 points1 point 2 days ago (0 children)

[–]CommanderVinegar 14 points15 points16 points 4 days ago (1 child)
A majority of the people on this sub either never touch premier or competitive, and if they do they’re amongst the majority of players hardstuck below 4K CSR.
Of course they don’t see any cheaters, all the cheaters are winning all their games and are at 15k and above. “Regret” the 30th highest ranked player on the world leaderboard is a cheater with a 90 something percent win rate.
CSGO had the same issue above SMFC. If you’re having a good game someone on the other team starts to toggle and then someone on your team toggles and it ends up being HvH.
VAC ban waves are an incredibly outdated way of implementing an anticheat. Yes faceit and Valorant both have cheaters no game is cheat free BUT having a real anticheat makes it much harder for people to cheat and when they do cheat it’s more likely they get detected.

[–]hushpuppi3CS2 HYPE 4 points5 points6 points 4 days ago (0 children)
VAC ban waves are an incredibly outdated way of implementing an anticheat.
I could see it being a very beneficial method of using anticheat if it actually did something to prevent cheaters of finding new ways to bypass it. Seems like after every big 'ban wave' the cheats are up and running a day or 2 later.
Whats the point?

[–]fisken2000 9 points10 points11 points 4 days ago* (1 child)

Yep, 16k here, and it’s gotten to the point where a cheater on my team and the other team isn’t a rarity anymore, it’s just tiring, 2 losers typing at each other crying about who has a better cheat while everyone else just sits there wasting time, watching 2 losers battle it out.

Before CS2, you would have never seen a single cheating post. There's only more now because of CS2's release and more people noticing it. The lack of demos when CS2 dropped just made it free for cheaters to cheat with zero consequence.

That’s not why they do it. They do it because it’s ultimately pointless and will make the subreddit unusable. What do a bunch of posts whining about cheating accomplish? Everyone is aware of the cheating. Valve is aware of the cheating. It’s not going to change anything, it’ll just make the subreddit shittier to interact with so people will leave.

The only people against kernel level anti cheat couldn't explain to you wtf a kernel is, let alone what "kernel level" meant in depth. They'd have a heart attack if they saw how many programs and software have that level of access.

[–]ireallydontwannadieCS2 HYPE -1 points0 points1 point 3 days ago* (2 children)
No, you idiots seem to not understand the possible consequences of push for kernel level anti cheat. You guys seem to have memory of a goldfish. Have you forgotten RCE exploits of CS:GO?
Since you don't trust us and you think it's "safe", then why does Riot offer 100K$ in their bounty program?: https://hackerone.com/riot?type=team
An exploit of that nature would go for millions in not-so-legal places.
It's not a matter of if but when. It only has to happen once for serious consequences.
Now let's talk about it from a different perspective, it's a cat and mouse game. What's stopping hackers/cheaters from loading the kernel module earlier than anti cheat or even worse, loading them as EFI binaries even before the OS boots?
Internet has gotten unbearable because of people like you these last few years. I won't be cornered and wait for the inevitable. I know I'm just a single guy but at least I'll get to say "I told you so".

People who actively beg for kernel-level AC usually have absolutely 0 idea on what that means.

Running a 3rd party kernel driver does not equate to normal drivers that actually are required by the kernel for functionality. If you could provide some examples that are comparable, I'd like to hear.

i’ve played cs for 20 years at a high level in all versions since 1.5 and vac always falls short. 
i think valorant would become the main tac shooter for the market if they released a mode that disabled all agent skills and added 4 grenades to the buy menu which fills those slots in the UI/keyboard shortcuts lol. no 3rd party client to install. idk if players with sunk cost in skin market would jump, but that game’s gun play and movement feels more like cs to me. the servers are excellent and the anticheat is better… literally just the skills that lost my interest.

I wish Valve would at least make a statement about it. Is it something in progress? Have they considered it and they're just against it?

Now now...the claim by Hiko isn't "Valorant has perfect anti-cheat", it's not perfect and someone I know blatantly gets away from cheating.
What Valorant did better was actually introducing an anti-cheat software from 2020s that was a seperate software with seperate workers to improve it, Valve is just being notoriously lazy with VAC that "Oh I had a cheater in my lobby whatever" just became a common sentence in CS2 and it was like that for a while in TF2.

There are definitely legal and ethical considerations valve would have to take into account (different country privacy laws). They would have to update their terms and conditions. There's probably way more growing pains with creating an intrusive anticheat (a lot of false positives at first I bet).

[–]Ghosty141400k Celebration 3 points4 points5 points 4 days ago (23 children)
One word: Linux.
If you want proper anti-cheat you can't support linux simply because there are too many loopholes to get around anti cheat. Valorant only doesn't run on linux cause the anti-cheat doesn't support it, tbf almost no anti cheat really supports linux, they become horribly ineffective.
Why am I saying this? Well running your game in VM isn't like it was in 2010 or smth, nowadays proper GPU passthrough etc. has become super easy and creating a VM for playing (with rather small input lag) is super easy. 
So would an intrusive anti cheat help? Of course, but it'll only catch the ones who were not even trying to hide it or used very "bad" cheats (free, public etc. etc.). I don't think it would make that big of a difference for people who decent trust factor.

[–]Hypno98[S] 9 points10 points11 points 4 days ago (1 child)
The vast majority of cheaters would probably be deterred if they needed to run Linux
Most cheaters are just end user who knows as much about tech than your average boomer dad
It's like gun violence, the more hoops people have to jump through the more people just give up on the idea

[–]Ghosty141400k Celebration -1 points0 points1 point 4 days ago (0 children)
Generally I agree, it will definitely help with the "noobs" but setting up hyper-v is trivial and you just need to go through an installation wizard. 
It's like gun violence, the more hoops people have to jump through the more people just give up on the idea
Yeah I totally agree, i'm just saying I can see enough people getting around this by having "good" cheats and others running linux that there will still be a significant margin.
Apart from that I've played over 5-6k hours now and encounter VERY few people that I'd say are definitely cheating. I personally get accused more of cheating than I encounter cheaters. The community just likes to blame the others instead of accepting that people get lucky sometimes or just play better.

[–]roge-500k Celebration 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago (1 child)
If you want proper anti-cheat you can't support linux simply because there are too many loopholes to get around anti cheat. 
It's not impossible. It would just require a lot of engineering and for users to voluntarily lock down their systems quite a bit.
The systemd folk have been working on making TPM2 and Measured Boot work nicely on Linux systems. If you wanted a kernel-level anti-cheat on Linux that couldn't be subverted, you could setup Measured Boot policies in the TPM which would only allow vendor-signed bootloaders, kernels, drivers, etc. to load.
Once the system is booted, you could then use the TPM in order to attest that the system is in a known configuration before streaming anti-cheat modules.
That being said, this would greatly limit the user's control over their own system, which is something a lot of Linux users may not be used to. It would also create problems for anyone using devices that require drivers that aren't readily available as vendor-signed kernel modules and are not present in vendor-signed kernels.

[–]MichaelDeets 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)
While perhaps possible, I'd imagine the Linux implementation would be much less intrusive. I would use EAC as an example, but obviously running in WINE and natively on Linux is going to be different. 
Even FaceIt, at least Windows 10, doesn't require TPM afaik. I have never used TPM2.0, nor given it a second look, so I don't know much about it (let alone "Measured Boot", which I've never heard of). 
Do you happen to know if SystemD's implementation of TPM2.0/Measured Boot would be modular, such as other projects like SystemD-udev, or be integrated into SystemD? I haven't touched SystemD (outside 1 or 2 modules) in a few years, so I'm quite out of touch.

[–]Darkoplax 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago (6 children)
Bro if some1 put that much effort to setup then sure but average every day cheater just downloaded or bought the cheats and ran it and have no clue how it works

[–]Ghosty141400k Celebration 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago (5 children)
You are all massively overestimating the amount of work for the setup. We are talking 20 minutes following a guide through a setup wizard. The cheat maker can take care of everything else, including having steam installed etc.
What I'm saying, the intrusive anti cheat, even if it somehow is crazy good will only partly solve the issue, mostly those who use "bad" cheats and don't give a shit.

[–]Tomico86 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)

[–]uzna 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (3 children)
"The cheat maker can take care of everything else"yeah and that cheat would be 10x more expensive and your 15 year old Vladia in Russia wouldn't want to pay for it and risk getting banned anyways. it wouldn't partially fix the issue, it would mostly fix the issue, only minority of cheaters would remain.

[–]Ghosty141400k Celebration 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (2 children)
Programming a cheat for linux is far easier though and what I refer to with "take care of everything else" is creating a custom .iso to install the OS which takes like no time at all.

[–]uzna 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago* (1 child)
that's totally irrelevant. cheats will be way more expensive regardless of how much work it takes for cheat maker.
and you're massively overestimating average iq of cheater and expect them to know the basics of game hacking or anything coding related, other than brainless copy paste from github.
the fact is that 99% of the cheaters don't use linux, they're not willing to pay more than 10$ and they are not good enough coders to bypass decent kernel AC. so if kernel AC will filter out overwhelming majority of cheaters, that's a massive dub. meeting cheaters every 100th game is better than meeting cheaters every 3rd game. if that doesn't sound good for you then i advise you to check your ears.

The user doesn't need to know anything, most cheats have sleek UIs etc. nowadays anyway and work via a subscription model. The people behind that should easily be able to get a cheat to work on linux since there you have far more tools to get around stuff. 
For example the oldest trick in the book, LD_PRELOAD_PATH. Just to show how easy it is too do some funky stuff on linux that you have to work quite hard for on windows.

Let's not forget cheats also can be run on kernel level, and then we are back in cat and mouse situation again. With the addition of every user system being compromised.

[–]Agitated-Oil-715 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (2 children)
Yes and if vac was kernel level it could actually have a chance at catching them. Right now there is 0% chance for vac to catch kernel level cheat.

That's not true. AI anticheat could detect those cheats without kernel access.

I can't understand one you've provided. Cause it doesnt make sense.
If you dont have better air bags, you risk an injury. While having those you have to deal only with higher price of the car.
If you dont have better AC you risk bit of frustration from time to time. If you include kernel AC you compromise your whole system. Gains does not exeed profits.

[–]manek101 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (0 children)
While having those you have to deal only with higher price of the car.
There are other risks of Airbags too, airbags have known to cause injuries if improperly handled.     
risk bit of frustration from time to time.
The "Risk of frustration" basically ruins any kind of competitive integrity of the game. And idk about you I don't play games casually to get frustrated. So I can't play seriously and I can't play casual.      
If you include kernel AC you compromise your whole system.
You already comprise your whole system by installing a closed source game.
Many drivers have kernel level access too.
Microsoft themselves are a data company too.

It's exactly because it run on kernel level that you need kernel level AC, so you can scan the processes that attaches itself to your process and deal with it accordingly. Cat and mouse game IS inevitable, even with AI AC.

At what ranks does it get particularly bad (frequency would also be interesting - is once a day after playing 20 games that day)? At ~11k with my Trust Factor, it isn't horrible when playing as a causal weekender (certainly, the cheaters that Leetify inform me about were not obvious).
This isn't meant to be a defense of Valve's anti-cheating tech - I'm not particularly convinced of it's quality.
While I'm here, here's a great read on kernel-level anti cheats. The section about why Valve doesn't need a kernel-level driver to steal your banking information, or really do anything nefarious on your machine, is a good read for those who say that kernel level anti-cheats are "intrusive".

[–]KittenOnHunt 2 points3 points4 points 4 days ago (1 child)
I can only talk about my elo of course, but at 17k~ it's basically  50/50 if you get a cheater or not in the enemy team (I 5 stack so no chance to have one in my team)

[–]top2000 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)
one merit of playing causal 10v10 is people are generally nice enough to vote kick the cheater. I wonder if they can invent a runtime overwatch feature, that if someone is massively reported cheating, the game will instantly call up like 100 casual / afk players to watch the suspect and vote to suspend them and cancel the match. In short it's overwatch looking at live instead of replay.

Am I the only one who just never plays against cheaters? Am I just not realizing they are cheating? Every single one of my games has felt very fair, no cheating. Same thing in GO, very very rare I'd ever come across a cheater.

[–]HarshTheDev 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago (1 child)
What's your rating? That is a huge factor in whether you face cheaters or not. Lower elo generally doesn't have much cheaters since they quickly win and increase their elo.

You ain't at 15k+ rating nor were you ever above lem in csgo with that take. There was cheaters in EU Global and there is a lot of cheaters in 15k+ in premier to the point that legit people are going back to faceit.

[–]VariousDegreesOfNerd 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)
My experience has not been matching up with what everyone else has been saying for cheating. I have had 1 blatant cheater in the ~20 games I played between 10k and 15k. Certainly worse than my experience in csgo but also not the “unplayable above 12k” experience I’ve been seeing other people talk about.

[–]redstern -1 points0 points1 point 4 days ago (0 children)
No, there isn't an in between.  Your anti cheat is either running as an application level program that's detection ability is monitoring the game's files, detecting hooks, and using forensic detection to identify abnormal client behavior after the fact, or running as a kernel level driver that is able to monitor everything running on the computer in depth to sniff out cheat programs in real time.
VAC is as close to an in between as there is.  An AI based anti cheat, trained with years of human assisted reviews to monitor live games for cheats.  Doesn't work so great right now, but that should improve over time.  However without kernel level access, it's ability is severely restricted.
Valve being a private corporation, I would be much happier to give them access to my computer like that, than a public corp with a known history of spying.

[–]jcode7090 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)
Well the way I think about it, if you don’t have the ability to scan memory or something, obfuscation becomes a lot easier. Not only that, but with the exploits that valve or any other game company knows about, hack developers know about 50 more to use if something gets patched.
So no, not really.

[–]xtess3ractx -1 points0 points1 point 4 days ago (0 children)
I noticed since I enabled third party software, I see tons more cheaters.
I enabled 3rd party software because I didn't want to do display capture and only way to enable game capture is to enable 3rd party software.

the thing is hackers are infitly more likely to try and attack you from the OS since anyone who has a pc has one.

Valorant has a good anticheat.
There are many, probably tens of thousands of valorant players better than me.
But in a valorant match I never say "oh that person might be cheating" when I get dunked on because I know extremely likely he isn't
Guess in which game I have my doubts?

[–]ZeroUnderscoreOuCS2 HYPE 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (1 child)
That's just your perception though. You think there's no cheaters in Valorant so you don't accuse people there. You think there's a lot of cheaters in CS so you accuse people here. The same applies to most people on this subreddit and in average MM games. Something unexpected happens and they immediately think there's cheating involved.
Convince yourself that nobody cheats at your rank/trustfactor/region, and you'll have peace of mind.

[–]manek101 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago* (0 children)
Yep thats a good theory on paper you have but the issue lies in the experience.
In my 3 years of playing Valorant, I have encountered 1 blatant hacker.
In my 5 years of CS? I have lost count.
And that's just blatant hackers, passive hackers that Leetify tells me about are much more too, while passive hackers in Valorant that were banned were less than 5.
HvH servers don't exist in Valorant, atleast I never encountered one, but it wasn't too rare to find in CSGO, especially in specific game modes.     
There is a stat that the average age of an Account that gets a VAC ban is like 2+ years, so cheaters in CS probably have been playing and cheating for long.
So I'm not sure how many passive hackers are there that aren't banned yet.
Also the community of cheaters(streamers, forums, servers, content creators etc) in CS are far more than Valorant.    
Convince yourself that nobody cheats at your rank/trustfactor/region, and you'll have peace of mind.
So no I can't do this because I can't lie to myself that hard.
People's perceptions are built on experience.
And experience with CS anti cheat has been massively different.
Valorant has a smurf issue so many just blame smurfs when they get dunked on lol.
Thats the perception

[–]ZeroUnderscoreOuCS2 HYPE -2 points-1 points0 points 4 days ago* (0 children)

[–]leCereal -1 points0 points1 point 3 days ago (7 children)
People still seem to think that insta banning a cheater the moment they play the game is the best way to do it, which in reality is the WORST possible way.
In General it is ALWAYS better to ban in like 3-6 month waves even if the system knows someone is a cheater allready.
If you ban them instantly it would make it easy for the cheat devs to abuse the system to find out how valve is detecting it.
So if you see a cheater not being banned after a few weeks just know that if valve would be doing what you guys suggest they would actively fck themselves over.

[–]mtsilverred 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago (4 children)
Ah yes. Because Valorant which does that has tons of hackers, right? Oof.

[–]leCereal -1 points0 points1 point 3 days ago (3 children)
Riot also generally bans in waves, just google for once before commenting.
Did you never ask yourself why every game or online service ever does that? Its just common practice, but people dont really get that.
Just like the dota example recently (just google dota honeypot) devs try to actively ban cheater in a way that makes the process of developing cheats as hard as possible.

[–]mtsilverred 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago (0 children)
I’ve had hackers banned mid game in Valorant. Ban waves are for specific programs where they know what is happening. 
Most hackers I’ve ever met in Valorant was literally a surprise, because they were randomly removed from the game without us even knowing he was hacking.

[–]mtsilverred 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)
They also do ban waves not because there’s a back and forth between hacker and company.
Hackers know bandages are coming within X amount of time and work on changing how theirs work. There is not much difference in banning instantly and banning later. It changes very little. 
I’d argue that it is just better for the company to not ban because the hacker playing more is likely to potentially use money. Both with CS and Valorant, almost any game that sells in-game skins.

[–]mtsilverred 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)
I would know. I have a bud who used to sit in a certain Discord channel that would get pings saying “it’s been detected” and then the devs would tweak it and re release it almost the same day. Lmao.

Yea you are rights for them it’s better to release in waves, you also accept as dev that people are playing against cheaters in ur game while maybe the system already knows they are. Is this good?

[–]leCereal -1 points0 points1 point 3 days ago (0 children)
Yeah thats true, it might feels bad for the player at first. But not delaying the bans just leads to cheats that are harder to detect in the future so the player doesnt gain anything but more cheaters down the road.

[–]lefboop -1 points0 points1 point 4 days ago (0 children)
The problem is that there are a lot of cheaters, but it's at the same time an overblown problem by a large amount of the community.
Personally every time I came back to cs, and had to climb out of gold nova, I would get called a cheater and reported 99% of my games until I reached something like Supreme. 
In my experience I would almost never see any cheater on lower ranks. But as soon as I got close to Global Elite, I would start to see a bunch of cheaters. not as many as to completely ruin the game, but enough to remind me why I mostly played third party services, and move to those places again or quit for a couple of months and repeat.
Right now on cs2 basically it's the same shit. Just like Hiko says, around the 15k mark you start to get matched with cheaters. Not every single game, but enough to just make it annoying to play and that's why everyone is now playing faceit. In fact on that same stream, when the game had started, hiko said that on 2 weeks he hadn't encountered a single cheater, and those guys were the first ones.
But for most of the player base under 10k? They are probably just chilling, not going against that many cheaters (not gonna say its 0, but most cheaters WILL climb out to 15k), and have "good" games for their skill level. The problem is that they also believe everyone is a cheater, so any player having a somewhat good game (or some actual good player climbing for whatever reason) will get called out as a cheater.
So the problem is at the same time big, because it fucks up with the high ranks, but overblown because the lower ranks also think they have the same problem but is not to the same extent and they just like throwing hackusations everywhere

Valve don't tend to speak on what they're working on, they rather tend to stay silent until they've released a change. Considering Valve's silence on the cheating issue we can safely assume they're working on an anti cheat change, and we won't know about it until it's ready. It could be tomorrow, it could be ten years from now. 
In the meantime please do not give cheaters the satisfaction they so desperately crave. Try to refrain from laying out verbally or emotionally. a simple GG go next will suffice. It's just a game and in time it will be fixed.

It’s a combination of the highly volatile mmr system valve are using and the incentive to cheat.
You can get banned, make a new acc and reach 20k rating by winning 20 games.
Sure, I guess Valve wants to address this by having vac live, but we aren’t there yet. We’re at the detection and learning phase of the game. So now there will be a lot of cheats that will be tested and most of them will get detected rather soon, and the rest eventually.
So the players are kinda the control group and the test subjects, and that means a certain amount of suffering. It’s probably for the overall good of the game eventually, maybe.
What I’d say is that if you get a cheater against you, you can only win in premier. You can still win rating from them, and if you lose you’ll get your ranking points back when they get banned.

I have three contributions here:
1- I'm at ~9k at the moment, good trust factor, and I've seen like one obvious cheater in the past week. Am I just lucky, or are the people who have always called cheats every game just forming a choir?
2- High rank CS:GO ranked competitive was always a shit show of cheaters, all the way up until the end. This is known.
3- I'm enjoying CS like I haven't in a long time. Is it perfect? No. Am I still able to have fun? Yes. It's wild to me that we buy the $70 trash fire that is CoD every year and just accept that it's going to be garbage, then get CS2 for free and cry about everything that isn't EXACTLY like CS:GO

CS has a cheating issue, but it's definitely not every game.   
High rank CS:GO ranked competitive was always a shit show of cheaters, all the way up until the end. This is known.
1) People expected things to change with CS2, new engine, new game, maybe a better VAC and more secure gameplay?      
2) Premier at a high level gave cheaters even more incentive to cheat, a leaderboard, i.e. attention.     
It's wild to me that we buy the $70 trash
Yea mate, many people don't.     
then get CS2 for free and cry about everything that isn't EXACTLY like CS:GO
Everything? I didn't see people complain much about the new Smokes, it seems like a good upgrade which people like. Its the things they fixed that weren't broken that piss people off.
Like the subtick situation was horrible till the last update. People might have cried less if stuff like that would've been fixed in beta when CSGO servers were still on, but we never got a good beta.
Many features are half baked too, like MR12 is a change that heavily requires economy changes rn.
People have thousands of hours and hundreds of $$ invested in this "free" game, they don't like being forced into a degradation in experience

Not a big deal but interesting language used by Hiko when describing the situation
When you go above 15k "everyone complains about it" not that everyone is cheating. Which I know is the point he is making but it made me think that I wonder how much placebo effect could there be from people just assuming better players must be cheating because we know CS has a cheating issue 
I agree that it's much worse and CS2 made it worse as well so I'd support a change/more intrusive anti-cheat (which valve will never make)

I understand your point but its pretty obvious most of the time because the barrier to entry to cheating is so low right now.
Even players on my team are obviously cheating, bot movement they obviously aren't comfortable, playing positions weirdly but having god-tier timing in fights, super weird looking flicks and highly unusual ways of pre-aiming etc, what really sucks is running into a good player that also cheats.

Either that or he’s trying to imply that it’s a widely experienced issue past 15k, trying to emphasize how big the issue is, but I definitely understand interpreting it the other way.
Even if I I rule out the people I think are closet cheating, and only count the guys that have been hard-aimbotting/aiming at the ground with an autosniper it still outranks how bad cheating was in csgo.
I experienced 1 spinbotter between 2022-pre cs2 release, he was banned within a month. Cs2 has matched me up with 12 blatant aimbotters the past 3 weeks. Ones you could say without a shadow of a doubt, and those are the ones ABSOLUTELY indisputable, the closet wallers and soft-aimers are in the 20s of the last 3 weeks.
Literally had a 2v2 hack lobby on nuke which was miserable, one guy just insta scout headshotted everybody and my random cheaters admitted to having a DMA client or whatever so he couldn’t out-perform the other guy, the other two weren’t going so hard.
I just gave up on trying to get a good premier rank, right now I’m sitting at 16k, just gonna play faceit and play a premier game once in a while to keep my rank.
Thinking of making a compilation for YouTube here soon to showcase the problem (I have no experience with software recording so it’ll be tedious but worth it). I haven’t experienced this blatant of cheaters since the spinbotter I had back in august of 2022.

Such a bad take. Valorant was a new game and with kernel level anti cheat, it took a little bit  more time. How is it now at a higher level? All I hear are cheating complaints. Kernel level did nothing. Cs2 is built nearly on the same code as csgo. Easier for cheat devs to update. Next

Val does have a very very subtle cheater issue in high-er elos, but it's not even comparable to CS, with thanks mainly attributed to.... its kernel level AC.

I honestly think valve is collecting data and is focusing on fine tuning the game before dedicating time on vac. If they change code In the game, this may impact vac negatively. Ie: the amd driver issue after one of the updates. Community needs to see the grey area in game dev but I’m just a guy

I wouldn’t bet on it, the game has been infested for over a decade and Valve’s AC is one of the easiest for cheatdevs & scriptwriters to work on; infact I believe it’s one of the first they attempt to work on because of how simplistic it is. As CS players the only hope we have, and have ever had quite frankly, is to utilise faceit purely for its third party anticheat, MM is dead
We’d all love to huff copium about valve tackling cheaters but that ship sailed over 7 years ago unfortunately, what financial incentive do they have to fix the game? zero. It does not effect their case and key sales; the game financially operates via a crypto market, they make an absolute fortune and have no reason to make the MM experience better for us when they know that faceit will continue to do the heavy lifting
Valve will never opt into kernel unfortunately, due to their Linux support; but it’s also absurd to suggest that it wouldn’t partially solve an ultimately  unsolveable issue - any extra barriers for cheaters are still barriers. The reason valorant isn’t plagued by free cheats that take 5 minutes to install and inject mid-game is because of their AC.

"kernel level did nothing"
What the hell are you on about? I almost never see any cheaters at all in my games, and there are no cheaters at all in radiant.

[–]Pompz1 -5 points-4 points-3 points 4 days ago (3 children)
“Almost never” is the same as “almost always” in these discussions. People see and hear why they want. Still cheaters in the game even with kernel level. All it’s shown it’s as effective as vac. Cs community is just next level babies compares to valorant yet more kids on valorant. It’s sad.

[–]-hydroxy 7 points8 points9 points 4 days ago (0 children)
Nobody claimed kernel level ant-cheat was going to get rid of all cheaters. Will it do 10x a better job than VAC ever will? Yes, because VAC is a laughingstock of an anti-cheat.

Is this satire? There’s no way you can have a human brain in your skull and came to the conclusion that because valorant has cheaters that it in any way can be compared to CS less than favourably? 
Let’s break it down: There is no clearcut solution to cheating, you can only mask or minimise. Valorant does an excellent job, objectively, of minimising the cheater problem in valorant. The fact that high elo is the only area that issues are raised in is a good thing, because this is a fraction of the playerbase. CS has an issue in every single elo in MM, cheats can be injected mid game that cost nothing, paid cheats go undetected for thousands of games. What does Valve do to minimise the cheating issue? It is an absolute fact that Kernel level AC makes it more difficult to cheat. That’s the point. It obviously will never eliminate the problem because that is an impossible task.

Hiko is speaking from experience, he still plays valorant
You are speaking out of your ass

He said in the beginning and referencing the beginning of cs2. Takes time for cheaters but yes there are a ton of cheater in valorant at all ranks. Read what I said about being a brand new game and cs2 not being a brand new game. Common sense says it will take more time for a newer system to be cracked. High level takes do not attract useful dialog. Only circle jerks.

[–]Hypno98[S] 6 points7 points8 points 4 days ago (6 children)
If there was tons of cheaters at all ranks in Valorant no one would put it with it in high elos without a third party like FaceIt
Yet here we are. In Valorant streamers queud for hours in high elos with basically no cheaters in the official MM while 90% of high elo players are playing on Faceit in CS

[–]Pompz1 -2 points-1 points0 points 4 days ago (5 children)
“No one would put up with it” yet the top NA player streamed every day and put up with it. Only a handful of high ranked cheaters have been identified. “Basically no cheaters” and “basically a lot of cheaters” are subjective and the same take — still cheaters. 90% is a solid made up fact to win an online conversation unless you have sources. 
Your take is why cs community are bigger babies compared to the children who play valorant.
Edit: quick google , first post is the same cheater complaint post but in valorant.  Gg.

You found one thread that was posted 4 months ago made by a guy who is insanely delusional, even CS doesn't have cheaters every game. Get real

[–]Hypno98[S] 4 points5 points6 points 4 days ago (2 children)
yet the top NA player streamed every day and put up with it
You mean like Flom, Stewie2k or JasonR who gave up on premier and only play Faceit?
The only ''top NA player'' that hasn't given up on premier is Hiko
0% is a solid made up fact to win an online conversation unless you have sources
And yet you've been pulling everything you've said about the Valorant cheating situation out of your ass

[–]Pompz1 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (1 child)
Did you forget to mention JoJo who is literally #1 or just not using his name cause it doesn’t help your argument? Seems like him and the majority put up with it enough to get their rank. Your words are flawed with holes just like this circle jerk. 
Also I just posted a source. But again, we see and hear what we want.

[–]Hypno98[S] 5 points6 points7 points 4 days ago (0 children)
The majority are playing Faceit, 2 guys playing in MM while still saying there's a huge cheating problem isn't gonna change that reality
Your only proof of a cheating problem in valorant is one guy who says he's been in 500 games with  3 to 4 cheaters.
Get real

[–]sAsHiMi_ 6 points7 points8 points 4 days ago (4 children)
Lol there are no cheating complaints in val. I've had more cheaters in 1 day of playing cs2 than I have in all of val since beta.

[–]Pompz1 -5 points-4 points-3 points 4 days ago (3 children)

[–]sAsHiMi_ 5 points6 points7 points 4 days ago (1 child)
lol 4 months ago is the search with barely any activity on just shows how nonexistent cheating is in valorant

Thinking that Kernel access does nothing and is the same as Vac Live is pretty idiotic. There's a reason why even back in CSGO people complained less about hackers in FaceIt than in MM, heck there's a reason why a shit ton of games use Kernel instead of an untrained Ai that fails at differentiating a spinbot from a player spinning with high dpi

[–]fpgreenie 2 points3 points4 points 4 days ago (0 children)
My buds and I have swapped over to face it. We run into a cheater every other game at around 14k Elo.

[–]HJALMARI 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)
Of course it's bad they don't even have proper statistics for all your matches on premier yet, unfinished like so many other things.

[+]Double-Window9612 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)
Have to say as a low rank I haven't come across any obvious cheaters so seems like its more prevalent at the top levels

[–]ImUrFrand 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago (0 children)
there are other games on steam that people go into steam discussions to talk about it, and almost always are shame-gated by cheat deniers...
(most likely the cheaters, or the dumbs that throw a fit when anyone says there are cheats).

Played against 2 new accounts 4 hours yes 4 not 4k and 15k rating. Lost 13-11, if peekers advantage didn't favor wall hackers mighta beat them cuz they suck so bad at the game nonetheless.

Even low elo I've seen lot more cheaters. Barely saw them before but CS2 brought these losers out even more. I'll almost run into 1 cheater a day at this point.

[–]Rhed0xCS2 HYPE 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)
What this streamers usually forget is that a lot of people use their computer for tasks other than playing Counter-Strike. So having a kernel level anti cheat running at all time is simply not acceptable.

[–]GamerSpectrumCS2 HYPE 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)
finally hit 15k, got 4 games back to back with cheaters, now i hover around 148-- struggling to get 15k, its insane how much easier faceit is than premium because you dont get prefired by every hacker on the planet

[–]matterofakt 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago (0 children)
It always seem to be the players with <5 steam level, barely any hours played, and in some cases, profile private. Obviously not saying this applies to everyone with that criteria but for me personally, more often than not, it has.
