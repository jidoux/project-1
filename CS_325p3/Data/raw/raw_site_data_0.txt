That's not profitable. See I have an out there conspiracy theory that when the whole Mel Gibson thing happened; people saw that "backlash" and that helped prime our political climate to 2008-2016. Which in turn, got us to here.
I have NO evidence whatsoever, but that's my headcannon on where our timeline did a shift.

[–]dontaskme5746 5 points6 points7 points 2 months ago (3 children)
That fits with my memory of things.  Let's go with that.
I personally think that it was the huge number of people that felt poor, desperate, and lied to after the great recession.  When social media kept exploding around that same time, those vulnerable people latched on and never woke up.  It's a nasty thing to have an infinite scroll of jealousy and fear.
 
Exhibit #1: the West was able to absorb a highly questionable US election, 9/11, new oil wars, and the exposure of it all (Supreme Court case and Fahrenheit 9/11), yet still have rational conversations, agree to vaccinate our kids, and even see a minority president elected in the US.
The difference is we lost newspapers and suspected that we weren't all bouncing back from the recession in solidarity.  Rupert Murdoch saw the opportunity to profit from the feeling of disenfranchisement... and franchised it.

[–]DisorganizedSpaghett 2 points3 points4 points 2 months ago (2 children)

He isn't doing anywhere I would have seen it. I wouldn't know who the pillow guy was if he hadn't got in front of an international audience and told me he was a piece of shit.

Hard disagree

[–]zherok 4 points5 points6 points 2 months ago (3 children)
I don't think it's a particularly hot take to say he's more noteworthy for the memes around him than for his acting. His filmography is mostly forgettable other than a couple Canon film highlights, and he probably trended towards more flattering roles (Walker, Texas Ranger certainly fits that) that didn't exactly stretch his range that far. And if you've seen Firewalker, you know he's got basically zero comedic timing.
I'm not comparing him to like Daniel Day Lewis or anything, just as 80s action stars go there's no shortage of alternatives that have more interesting highs or are better "so bad its good" fodder or are just plain better actors than he is.

[+]Kooky_Alien -5 points-4 points-3 points 2 months ago (2 children)
I don’t have time to read your what seems to be fan rage at the moment but I will consider your opinion when I get a moment to actually read it and reconsider. 
I can say I thought it would be funny as fuck and not some fanboy rage shit I encountered. Reddits weird. 
Anywho I liked him in a few films and his “bad ass” persona he is hilariously showing in this Reddit post I thought was funny along with his weak voice to play Mr Rogers. It was only funny cause of how out of place it is. But whatever, wouldn’t want rage to get in the way of a good laugh. 
Besides, Tom Hanks did a great job…got anything against Tom Hanks?

I think there were many but there was one in particular aimed.at the guy who wrote the book filled with chuck Norris jokes. Originally he hated it and thought that it was some form of defamation.  For almost 20 years he was truly angry about the whole thing and even did interviews where he was asked about it. Eventually he came to realise that he'd been wrong this entire time and that people were idolising him and not only that, he was even more famous now because of it.

I mean it makes sense the jokes were stolen, they whole bit was first launched as a Vin Diesel Fact Generator site back in like 2004. Then it was almost immediately rehashed as Chuck Norris jokes because Conan O'Brien had the Chuck Norris lever, and that's the version everyone remembers.

[–]twinsunsspaces 4 points5 points6 points 2 months ago (0 children)
Speaking for the other guy, it’s not that he is a conservative, it’s that he is greedy and short sighted and a lot of conservatives happen to be those things. He was upset that someone was profiting from his name with a parody book and he wanted to stop them and take a bigger piece of the pie, so to speak, which is the greedy side of things. The short sighted is that because this increased his profile it was making the “pie” in this case much larger, so he was failing to see that his “slice” was actually getting bigger.

[–]generaltsao 6 points7 points8 points 2 months ago (9 children)
that’s a terrible comparison. streisand had a legitimate gripe with a neighbor, a private disagreement. she made mistakes that led to that being published. norris had global good will, on tap, and he was PISSED about it. he is also a conservative jesus freak. so obviously he’s a dumbass

A lot of really young people giving you really bad responses. The Chuck Norris jokes started all the way back in the 90's, before any fucking "Fact Generator" or WoW Barrens Chat or anything else. It just started because it was fun. Chuck Norris is essentially an unstoppable super hero in his movies (especially at the time), leading to all the jokes about him being invincible. They have gone way further these days - used to be just a handful of them.

Maybe the left needs to chill out on the line moving. I was a big fan of Clinton, and I despised Bush. I despise both parties now, so I'm pretty near the middle. My values didn't change, the values of the party have. I remember thinking how ridiculous it was how they went after Clinton for the bj and the college incident of smoking weed. Good God, have we gone downhill. Fanaticism is rampant now on both sides. Both sides are okay with their leadership doing evil things because you have to fight evil with evil. Everything is catch phrases now, alot of it is based on irrational thought. There's so many people that clearly have no idea what's actually going on, and we try to blame these people, but both sides own the news and all the media. Our government doesn't understand why the people don't trust them, but they're the cause. There's 2 big narratives going around, and I'm sure the truth is somewhere in there, but this situation is a result of bad leadership and rampant corruption on both sides. The real big gutshot was watching the democratic party fuck over Sanders in 2016 elections. I felt that he genuinely wanted to help the country.

Oh wow, you must have missed it. It was Minneapolis in 2020. A dirtbag police officer used excessive force and murdered an African American man named George Floyd. After that, riots started happening, and there was a large BLM movement involvement. Billions were lost in the fires. There were over 164 separate structure fires set. The democratic party not only failed to condemn this, but they then labeled it positively as the "Summer of Love." There were influencers out on scene doing live streams of the event happening. It was wild.

[–]Corasin -5 points-4 points-3 points 2 months ago (4 children)
Ok. Just to make sure that I understand. I brought up democrats calling the riots, damage to homes and loss of life a "Summer of Love" and you're asking me for sources after telling me that you won't accept the source that's a news interview where Democrat representative Jenny Durkan says that it's just people hanging out and could be a summer of love while a pictures of armed rioters are rioting.

[–]AussieEquiv 9 points10 points11 points 2 months ago (3 children)

To clarify, are you talking about the time leftists burned Atlanta or the time antifascists burned Dresden?

[–]bullwinkle8088 4 points5 points6 points 2 months ago (2 children)
Atlanta is still mad at Sherman for that, but not for the reason you think.
The goofy intersections in Atlanta are a result of the rebuilding after the Civil War. Prior to the war Atlanta was built on a traditional grid layout. After the war the railroads were rebuilt first and followed the lay of the land. The roads were built following the tracks and the reconstruction spread outward from there because that is how supplies came. This the messed up intersections are a lasting penalty of the civil war.

[–]Mysterious_Andy -2 points-1 points0 points 2 months ago* (1 child)
I live in Atlanta. It’s even worse than you think.
Edit: To clarify, our streets weave like drunks, change names unexpectedly, switch directions at intersections, are named confusingly, and I swear to St. Sherman himself a few of them curve back and cross themselves. I think I’ve stood at the intersection of Peachtree and Peachtree and off in the distance seen myself staring back from the corner of Peachtree and Peachtree.

[–]thewrongstuff77 18 points19 points20 points 2 months ago (6 children)
I mean, one stormed the capital, and one burned down a city.
So one group rioted and destroyed some stores (absolutely not a city, what a ridiculous thing to say). And one group literally attempted to attack our congress in order to stop the peaceful, democratic transfer of presidential power in an attempt to force their own losing candidate to stay in power.
Now, which of those is worse and more damaging to the country and the democratic way of life as a whole? Because it's not even close. Now before you build the usual straw man, I'm not defending any riots. The violent rioters were way out of line and deserve to see consequences. I'm clarifying that the riots were not even close to "burning down a city". And I'm also clarifying the fact that comparing those two things as if they are equal is like saying I'm just as bad as Charles Manson because I stole a dozen eggs once in college.
u/corasin I would genuinely love to hear your response to my comment, please.

[–]thraashman 7 points8 points9 points 2 months ago (0 children)
And the thing is, only one group was political. One was absolutely fervent Republican supporters of Donald Trump who did it for political reasons. The other one was every day people tired of police brutality. Sure, Republicans largely attribute anyone angry at police brutality as being a Democrat since Republicans support police brutality so long as it happens to a minority. But only one group was actually political in nature.
These "both sides" assholes trying to attribute a group that isn't on a political side as having one are playing right into the hands of the extremists that control the right wing.

[–]Corasin -5 points-4 points-3 points 2 months ago (4 children)
Evil is evil and I don't need to determine or think about which is worse. This exactly proves my point though. So many people now are okay with the evil that their party does because it's the lesser evil. It's ridiculous.

[–]DodGamnBunofaSitch 8 points9 points10 points 2 months ago* (3 children)
I think by ignoring how the BLM protests were around 94% peaceful, and many of the 'riots' were proven to be caused by either the police  breaking a window and declaring it a riot (see 'police riots), or other agitators not affiliated with the actual protests, and comparing them to people who tried to overthrow the government sure makes you look like just another right wing propagandist declaring 'both sides'  to diminish TRYING TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT
it sure as hell is ridiculous.
edit: formatting

[–]Corasin -3 points-2 points-1 points 2 months ago (2 children)
Why does 94% of the peaceful protestors get absolved at the riots in 2020 but not on the Jan 6 thing? It feels like you might have some kind of agenda there. Crime for crime, 19 people confirmed dead from the 2020 riots, how many from the jan 6 event?

[–]DodGamnBunofaSitch 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago (0 children)
'absolved of the riots' that they had no part in? that they might not even have been in the same city or state as?
the people who did do crimes like riots or property destruction during the BLM protests were prosecuted.
the people involved in deaths during the protests were prosecuted.
and the jan 6 "event" was an insurrection
you want to call things the right name, you should start refering to 'the event' as 'the attempted insurrection', because that's what it was and that's WHAT MAKES IT WORSE
good grief, you're ridiculously propagandized and biased.
and you have the gall to tell me I've got an agenda?
say it. just admit that 1/6 was an insurrection attempting to overthrow a legal election.

The both sides fallacy is wrong and lazy thinking. This article was written at the beginning of the pandemic, but the substance of it still holds true today. Both sides are, in fact, not equally to blame for the current state of political division. One side, Republicans, have moved to the extreme right and are no longer concerned with actual policy.

I surely wouldn't be able to find a similar article written by a republican blaming the democrats? Lol. Dude come on.

[–]ialwayschoosepsyduck 9 points10 points11 points 2 months ago (2 children)
You should really do your due diligence. About the writer of that article:
Tony is a writer, teacher, speaker and ordained minister (United Church of Christ). He served as Senior Minister of Seattle’s Plymouth Congregational Church for fourteen years. His newest book is Useful Wisdom: Letters to Young (and not so young) Ministers. He divides his time between Seattle and a cabin in Wallowa County of northeastern Oregon.
He sounds a little conservative but more of an independent. If nothing else, he's deeply religious and likely tries to find a middle ground where good work can be done on vital issues.
That's the problem with Republicans today. You cannot appreciate opinions from the middle because you label them as Democrat and, as such, refuse to engage with the material.

[–]Corasin -4 points-3 points-2 points 2 months ago (1 child)
Lol. Point proven! I said my political history. Since I don't agree with you, I'm a typical republican. Why should I do my due diligence on a writer that someone else linked? You didn't. I read the same clip at the bottom of the article. Why are my assumptions less valid than yours? Sure, he's religious. Lots of democrats are. That doesn't make someone a republican. Now mine, I assumed that he was democrats because of how he wrote about Republicans. Could feel the distaste in the writing. But that's the problem with democrats today. They see a key word and make judgment. Yours was the word minister, so he must be republican.

That's brought up frequently, and that type of thinking is just as wrong and lazy. Both sides having responsibility is not the same as both sides have an equal responsibility. More so, each party acknowledging their responsibility is what's key to a solution, not just identifying the others. 
Think of it this way:
A bully feels like the person he's bullying is acting in a way that deserves it. Not that he's being this asshole bully. And what do we know about bullies? That aggression is coming from an internal lack of confidence, or whatever it may be, And it's only challenging it that gets them to stop, continually acquiescing to them only makes it worse. Somebody getting bullied day in and day out that just keeps letting it happen eventually shares in the responsibility, but in a much smaller way. And establishing that the bully is the responsible one is not going to suddenly change the situation, The guy getting bullied taking responsibility for what he can do will.  
In the same way, both parties can do relatively small things that elicit much larger reactions on the other side. And that's because the two parties, and every single individual, have different values and priorities. One thing the both parties do, and have always done, is react to other party like it's going to be the death of everyone and everything. And that just emboldens the other side. 
And what do we know about the Republican party? They are reactionary. They have little to no platform of their own. Making things easy for them to react to is just as much the left's responsibility as it is the rights for overreacting to it.

Norris jumped in on the whole birther conspiracy about Obama, writing an open letter to Obama saying he should release his birth certificate.
After that, he publicly supported various very dubious Republican candidates. One was Roy Moore of Alabama, after he was removed from office for refusing to comply with federal law. Another was Blake Masters, who promoted Trump’s stolen election claims in his campaign ads.
Basically Norris is not just conservative, he’s far right wackadoodle conservative.

The birther conspiracy was racist.

[–]Corasin -3 points-2 points-1 points 2 months ago (3 children)
To believe that Chuck Norris was racist, I'd want to see something originating from him that's racist. I get that the conspiracy theory is that he's a secret Muslim terrorist which seems absolutely ridiculous. That in itself is racist and if Chuck Norris was pushing that part of it then I would agree. That being said, everyone here wants me to believe he's racist on their word because stereotypical republican should be evidence enough. No one is providing anything directly from him though. How do you know that he wasn't just concerned about the legitimacy of his citizenship? Being a legitimate citizen in itself isn't racist because we are a nation of all races.

[–]goj1ra 2 points3 points4 points 2 months ago* (0 children)
How do you know that he wasn't just concerned about the legitimacy of his citizenship?
Why hasn’t he been concerned about the legitimacy of citizenship of any other political candidate? What is it about Obama that was different?
When someone publicly supports a racist campaign, it’s pretty natural to assume they’re racist. Of course it’s also possible that Norris is just thick, and didn’t understand what he was supporting.
But it doesn’t matter that much either way. I didn’t mention race in my comment above, because the things Norris is clearly on record as having supported are bad enough.

Those things don’t all equate, and quite the contrary to your belief, that doesn’t mean fascist. 
You do realize that there are genuine Christian folk(religious) who’d want nothing, but the best for you? Who’d supplement your needs with no expectations on your end? Try asking yourself, why is this man saying what he’s saying, before jumping the gun? 
I know it can be a little scary to hear that someone supports Trump, but that doesn’t mean they believe in everything he does. Myself(black man) will vote for trump because he’s the only anti-war candidate that stands a chance in this election.
